Storyline
A long time ago, far away on the planet of Cybertron, a war was being waged between the noble Autobots (led by the wise Optimus Prime) and the devious Decepticons (commanded by the dreaded Megatron) for control over the Allspark, a mystical talisman that would grant unlimited power to whoever possessed it. The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, but Megatron blasted off in search of it. He eventually tracked it to the planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sent him right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forced him into a paralyzed state. His body was later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, and before going into a comatose state Megatron used the last of his energy to engrave a map, showing the location of the Allspark, into the Captain&#x27;s glasses, and send a transmission to Cybertron. He is then carted away by the Captain&#x27;s ship. A century later...

Trivia
Devastator's alternate mode, a hybrid tank resembling the M1 Abrams and Leopard II, was a remodeled version of the "stealth tank" from 
xXx: State of the Union. Michael Bay had browsed through all the tanks in the United States Military to find the right tank to serve as Devastator's alternate mode, but finally settled on the stealth tank which he felt had the proper attitude for a Decepticon (it was mean, authoritarian and weapon-loaded). Additionally, the prop tank is much lighter than a real one, which was of benefit when most on-screen action was of it driving on paved roads.

Crazy Credits
Though hardly recognizable, the Paramount and DreamWorks jingles at the beginning are the original ones heavily altered digitally to be darker and robotic. They then merge with the title sequence music.

&quot;You shoot, I&#39;ll drive!&quot;

19 June 2007 | by SUPAN0VA (Australia)
    &ndash; See all my reviews


And drive he does as Michael Bay translates the Transformers world of
animation and toys to the big screen.But before I get ahead of myself I have to admit I never watched even a
single episode growing up. I had just hit high school and I wasn&#39;t
interested. So there wasn&#39;t any real baggage involved either side of
the coin.Yet there I sat in the first public screening anywhere on the planet
(June 12th in Sydney, Australia, with Michael Bay introducing it) and
it just overwhelmed me and everyone else! There was never a dull
moment, the script flowed easily, the acting was first-rate and the
seamlessness of the CGI and live action was taken to another level.It&#39;s going to be the hit of the summer and was better than any of the
big third installment trilogies I have just also seen. And I love each
of those franchises.Congratulations on a movie that not only met expectations but exceeded
them.

Transformers


Publication information


First appearance
1984[1]


Created by
Hasbro and Takara Tomy


In-story information


Base(s)
Cybertron


Transformers is a Hasbro toy line centered on two factions of warring alien robots which are called the Autobots and the Decepticons. In its 26-year history, the toyline has expanded to encompass comic books, animation, video games and movies.[2]
Transformers: G1 includes both the animated television series The Transformers and the Marvel Comics comic-book series of the same name, which is further divided into Japanese and British spin-offs, respectively. Sequels followed, such as the Generation 2 comic book and Beast Wars TV series, which became its own mini-universe. Generation 1 characters underwent two reboots with Dreamwave in 2001 and IDW Publishing in 2005, also as a remastered series. There have been other incarnations of the story based on different toy lines during after 20th-Century. The first was the Robots in Disguise series, followed by three shows that consist of the "Unicron Trilogy" (consisting of Armada, Energon, and Cybertron). A live-action film was also released in 2007 and a sequel has since been released in 2009, again distinct from previous incarnations, while the Transformers Animated series merged concepts from the G1 story-arc, the 2007 live-action film and "Unicron Trilogy".

[edit] Transformers: Generation 1 (1984 / 1985–1994)
Main articles: Transformers: Generation 1 and The Transformers (TV series)




Spider-Man battles Megatron on the cover of The Transformers #3


Generation One (G1) is a race for the cube between Megatron and Optimus Prime, retroactive terms for the Transformers characters that appeared between 1984 and 1992. The Transformers began with the 1980s Japanese toy lines Microman and Diaclone. The former utilized varying humanoid-type figures while the latter presented robots able to transform into everyday vehicles, electronic items or weapons. Hasbro, fresh from the success of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, which utilized the Microman technology to great success, bought the Diaclone toys, and partnered with Takara.[3] Jim Shooter and Dennis O'Neil were hired by Hasbro to create the backstory, the latter of whom christened Optimus Prime.[4] Afterwards, Bob Budiansky created most of the Transformers characters, giving names and personalities to many unnamed Diaclone figures.[5] The primary concept of G1 is that the heroic Optimus Prime, the villainous Megatron, and their finest soldiers crash land on pre-historic Earth in the Ark and the Nemesis before awakening in 1984, Cybertron hurtling through the Neutral zone as an effect of the war. The Marvel comic was originally part of the main Marvel Universe, with appearances from Spider-Man and Nick Fury, plus some cameos,[6] as well as a visit to the Savage Land.[7]
The Transformers TV series began around the same time. Produced by Sunbow Productions. later Hasbro Productions, from the start it contradicted Budiansky's backstories. The TV series shows the Autobots looking for new energy sources, and crash landing as the Decepticons attack.[8] Marvel interpreted the Autobots as destroying a rogue asteroid approaching Cybertron.[9] Shockwave is loyal to Megatron in the TV series, keeping Cybertron in a stalemate during his absence,[10] but in the comic book he attempts to take command of the Decepticons.[11] The TV series would also differ wildly from the origins Budiansky had created for the Dinobots,[12][13] the Decepticon turned Autobot Jetfire[14] (known as Skyfire on TV[15]), the Constructicons (who combine to form Devastator),[16][17] and Omega Supreme.[16][18] The Marvel comic establishes early on that Prime wields the Creation Matrix, which gives life to machines. In the second season, the two-part episode The Key to Vector Sigma introduced the ancient Vector Sigma computer, which served the same original purpose as the Creation Matrix (giving life to Transformers), and its guardian Alpha Trion.
In 1986, the cartoon became the film The Transformers: The Movie, which is set in the year 2005. It introduced the Matrix as the "Autobot Matrix of Leadership", as a fatally wounded Prime gives it to Ultra Magnus; however, as Prime dies he drops the matrix, which is then caught by Hot Rod who subsequently becomes Rodimus Prime later on in the film. Unicron, a transformer who devours planets, fears its power and recreates a heavily damaged Megatron as Galvatron, as well as Skywarp becoming Cyclonus, Thundercracker becoming Scourge and the three Insecticons becoming Scourge's huntsmen, The Sweeps. Eventually, Rodimus Prime takes out the Matrix and destroys Unicron.[19] In the United Kingdom, the weekly comic book interspliced original material to keep up with U.S. reprints,[20] and The Movie provided much new material. Writer Simon Furman proceeded to expand the continuity with movie spin-offs involving the time travelling Galvatron.[21][22] The Movie also featured guest voices from Leonard Nimoy as Galvatron, Scatman Crothers as Jazz, Casey Kasem as Cliffjumper, Orson Welles as Unicron and Eric Idle as the leader of the Junkions (Wreck-Gar, though unnamed in the movie). The Transformers theme tune for the film was performed by Lion with Weird Al Yankovic adding a song to the soundtrack.
The third season followed up The Movie film, with the revelation of the Quintessons having used Cybertron as a factory. Their robots rebel, and in time the workers become the Autobots and the soldiers become the Decepticons. It is the Autobots who develop transformation.[23] Due to popular demand,[24] Optimus Prime is resurrected at the conclusion of the third season,[25] and the series ended with a three-episode story arc. However, the Japanese broadcast of the series was supplemented with a newly-produced OVA, Scramble City, before creating entirely new series to continue the storyline, ignoring the 1987 end of the American series. The extended Japanese run consisted of The Headmasters, Super-God Masterforce, Victory and Zone, then in illustrated magazine form as Battlestars: Return of Convoy and Operation: Combination. Just as the TV series was wrapping up, Marvel continued to expand its continuity. It followed The Movie's example by killing Prime[26] and Megatron,[27] albeit in the present day. Dinobot leader Grimlock takes over as Autobot leader.[28] There was a G.I. Joe crossover[29] and the limited series The Transformers: Headmasters, which further expanded the scope to the planet Nebulon.[30] It led on to the main title resurrecting Prime as a Powermaster.[31]
In the United Kingdom, the mythology continued to grow. Primus was introduced as the creator of the Transformers, to serve his material body that is planet Cybertron and fight his nemesis Unicron.[32] Female Autobot Arcee also appeared, despite the comic book stating the Transformers had no concept of gender, with her backstory of being built by the Autobots to quell human accusations of sexism.[33] Soundwave, Megatron's second-in-command, also broke the fourth wall in the letters page, criticising the cartoon continuity as an inaccurate representation of history.[34] The UK also had a crossover in Action Force, the UK counterpart to G.I. Joe.[35] The comic book featured a resurrected Megatron,[36] whom Furman retconned to be a clone[37] when he took over the U.S. comic book, which depicted Megatron as still dead.[38] The U.S. comic would last for 80 issues until 1991, and the UK comic lasted 332 issues and several annuals, Until it will be replaced into as Dreamwave Productions type, later in after the 20th-Century.
In 2009, Shout! Factory released the entire G1 series in a 16-DVD box set called The Matrix Of Leadership Edition. They also released the same content as individual seasons.
[edit] Transformers: Generation 2 (1993–1995)
Main article: Transformers: Generation 2
It was five issues[39] of the G.I. Joe comic in 1993 that would springboard a return for Marvel's Transformers, with the new twelve-issue series Transformers: Generation 2, to market a new toy line. The UK comic came back for five issues and an annual. This story revealed that the Transformers originally breed asexually, though it is stopped by Primus as it produced the evil Swarm.[40] A new empire, neither Autobot nor Decepticon, is bringing it back, however. Though the year-long arc wrapped itself up with an alliance between Optimus Prime and Megatron, the final panel introduced the Liege Maximo, ancestor of the Decepticons.[41] This minor cliffhanger was not resolved until 2001 and 2002's Transforce convention when writer Simon Furman concluded his story in the exclusive novella Alignment.[42]
[edit] Beast Wars/Machines (1996–2000)
Main articles: Beast Wars and Beast Machines
The story focused on a small group of Maximals (the new Autobots), led by Optimus Primal, and Predacons, led by Megatron, 300 years after the "Great War". After a dangerous pursuit through transwarp space, both the Maximal and Predacon factions end up crash landing on a primitive, uncivilized planet similar to Earth, but with two moons and a dangerous level of Energon, which forces them to take organic beast forms in order to function without going into stasis lock.[43] After writing this first episode, Bob Forward and Larry DiTillio learned of the G1 Transformers, and began to use elements of it as a historical backstory to their scripts,[44] establishing Beast Wars as a part of the Generation 1 universe through numerous callbacks to both the cartoon and Marvel comic. By the end of the first season, the second moon and the Energon are revealed to have been constructed by a mysterious alien race known as the Vok.




Megatron attacks Optimus Prime in a clash of generations.


The destruction of the second moon releases mysterious energies that make some of the characters "transmetal" and the planet is revealed to be prehistoric Earth, leading to the discovery of the Ark. Megatron attempts to kill the original Optimus Prime,[45] but at the beginning of the third season, Primal manages to preserve his spark. In the two-season follow-up series, Beast Machines, Cybertron is revealed to have organic origins, which Megatron attempts to stamp out.
After the first season of Beast Wars (comprising 26 episodes) aired in Japan, the Japanese were faced with a problem. The second Canadian season was only 13 episodes long, not enough to warrant airing on Japanese TV. While they waited for the third Canadian season to be completed (thereby making 26 episodes in total when added to season 2), they produced two exclusive cel-animated series of their own, Beast Wars II (also called Beast Wars Second) and Beast Wars Neo, to fill in the gap. Dreamwave retroactively revealed Beast Wars to be the future of their G1 universe,[46] and the 2006 IDW comic book Beast Wars: The Gathering eventually confirmed the Japanese series to be canon.[47] within a story set during Season 3.[48]
Beast Wars contained elements from both the G1 cartoon series and comics. Attributes taken from the cartoon include Cybertron having an organic core, Transformers that were female, and the appearance of Starscream (who mentions being killed off by Galvatron in, The Transformers: The Movie). The naming of the Transformer ship, the "Ark" and the character, Ravage being shown as intelligent were elements taken from the comics.
[edit] Dreamwave Productions (2001–2005)
In 2001, Dreamwave Productions began a new universe of annual comics adapted from Marvel, but also included elements of the animated. The Dreamwave stories followed the concept of the Autobots defeating the Decepticons on Earth, but their 1997 return journey to Cybertron on the Ark II[49] is destroyed by Shockwave, now ruler of the planet.[50] The story follows on from there, and was told in two six-issue limited series, then a ten-issue ongoing series. The series also added extra complexities such as not all Transformers believing in the existence of Primus,[51] corruption in the Cybertronian government that first lead Megatron to begin his war[52] and Earth having an unknown relevance to Cybertron.[50][53]
Three Transformers: The War Within limited series were also published. These are set at the beginning of the Great War, and identify Prime as once being a clerk named Optronix.[54] Beast Wars was also retroactively stated as the future of this continuity, with the profile series More than Meets the Eye showing the Predacon Megatron looking at historical files detailing Dreamwave's characters and taking his name from the original Megatron.[46] In 2004, this real life universe also inspired three novels[55] and a Dorling Kindersley guide, which focused on Dreamwave as the "true" continuity when discussing in-universe elements of the characters. In a new twist, Primus and Unicron are siblings, formerly a being known as The One. Transformers: Micromasters, set after the Ark's disappearance, was also published. The real life universe was disrupted when Dreamwave went bankrupt in 2005.[56] This left the Generation One story hanging and the third volume of The War Within half finished. Plans for a comic book set between Beast Wars and Beast Machines were also left unrealized.[57]
[edit] G.I. Joe crossovers (2003 onwards)
Throughout the years, the G1 characters have also starred in crossovers with fellow Hasbro property G.I. Joe, but whereas those crossovers published by Marvel were in continuity with their larger storyline, those released by Dreamwave and G.I. Joe publisher Devil's Due Publishing occupy their own separate real life universes. In Devil's Due, the terrorist organization Cobra is responsible for finding and reactivating the Transformers. Dreamwave's version reimagines the familiar G1 and G.I. Joe characters in a World War II setting, and a second limited series was released set in the present day, though Dreamwave's bankruptcy meant it was cancelled after a single issue. Devil's Due had Cobra re-engineer the Transformers to turn into familiar Cobra vehicles, and released further mini-series that sent the characters travelling through time, battling Serpentor and being faced with the combined menace of Cobra-La and Unicron. During this time, Cobra teams up with the Decepticons. IDW Publishing has expressed interest in their own crossover.[58]
[edit] IDW publishing (2005 onwards)
Main article: The Transformers (IDW Publishing)
The following year, IDW Publishing rebooted the G1 series from scratch within various limited series and one shots. This allowed long-time writer of Marvel and Dreamwave comics, Simon Furman to create his own universe without continuity hindrance, similar to Ultimate Marvel.[59] Furman's story depicts a Cybertron that the rogue Pretender Thunderwing destroys,[60] so the Autobots and Decepticons have to infiltrate various planets for their resources. Earth comes under particular scrutiny due to a particularly potent form of energon, which Shockwave had seeded thousands of years ago,[61] with the Decepticons escalating political tensions by replacing people with clones.[62] The Ark origin is absent in this series.[63] The continuity was also the first to acknowledge the existence of mass displacement in transformations, such as when Megatron downsizes himself into a gun.[64]
[edit] Alternative stories
In January 2006, the Hasbro Transformers Collectors' Club comic wrote a story based on the Transformers Classics toy line, set in the Will Anderson Comics universe, but excluding the Generation 2 comic. Fifteen years after Megatron crash lands in the Ark with Ratchet, the war continues with the characters in their Classics bodies.[65]
IDW Publishing introduced The Transformers: Evolutions in 2006, a collection of mini-series that re-imagine and reinterpret the G1 characters in various ways. To date, only one miniseries has been published, Hearts of Steel, placing the characters in an Industrial Revolution-era setting. The series was delayed as Hasbro did not want to confuse newcomers with too many fictional universes before the release of the live-action film.[66]
However, IDW and the original publisher Marvel Comics announced a crossover storyline with the Avengers to coincide with the film New Avengers/Transformers.[67] The story is set on the borders of Symkaria and Latveria, and its fictional universe is set between the first two New Avengers storylines, as well in between the Infiltration and Escalation phase of IDW's The Transformers.[68] IDW editor-in-chief, Chris Ryall hinted at elements of it being carried over into the main continuities,[69] and that a sequel is possible.[70]
[edit] Robots in Disguise (2000–2001)
Main article: Transformers: Robots in Disguise
Broadcast in 2000, Robots in Disguise was a single animated series, imported from Japan (where it was broadcast the previous year), consisting of thirty-nine episodes. In this continuity, Megatron recreates the Decepticons as a subfaction of the Predacons on Earth, a potential reference to the return to the vehicle-based characters following the previous dominance of the animal-based characters of the Beast eras. It is a stand-alone universe with no ties to any other Transformers fiction, though some of the characters from Robots in Disguise did eventually make appearances in Transformers: Universe, including Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Side Burn and Prowl.
[edit] The Unicron Trilogy (2001 / 2002–2006)
Main articles: Transformers: Armada, Transformers: Energon, and Transformers: Cybertron
These three lines, with 1990s style, launched in 2002, preceded from 2001, and dubbed the "Unicron Trilogy" by Transformers designer Aaron Archer,[71] are co-productions between Hasbro and Takara, simultaneously released in both countries, each lasting 52 episodes. Armada followed the Autobots and Decepticons discovering the powerful Mini-Cons on Earth, which are revealed by the end to be weapons of Unicron. Energon, set ten years later, followed the Autobots stopping the Decepticons from resurrecting Unicron with energon.
In Japan, the series Transformers: Cybertron showed no ties to the previous two series, telling its own story. This caused continuity problems when Hasbro sold Cybertron as a follow-up to Armada/Energon. The writers attempted to change certain plot elements from the Japanese version to remedy this, although this largely added up to nothing more than references to Unicron, Primus, Primes and Minicons.
Just as Marvel produced a companion comic to Generation One, Dreamwave Productions published the comic Transformers Armada set in a different continuity to the cartoon. At #19, it became Transformers Energon. Dreamwave went bankrupt and ceased all publications before the storyline could be completed at #30. However, the Transformers Fan Club published a few stories set in the Cybertron era.[72]
[edit] Transformers: Universe (2003–present)
Main article: Transformers: Universe
The storyline of Transformers: Universe, mainly set following Beast Machines, sees characters from many assorted alternate continuities, including existing and new ones, encountering each other. The story was told in an unfinished comic book exclusive to the Official Transformers Collectors' Convention.
[edit] Film franchise (2007–2011)
Main article: Transformers (film series)
Main articles: Transformers (film), Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon
In 2007, a live action film of Transformers was directed by Michael Bay and produced by Steven Spielberg. The main focus of the film revolved around the creator of the Transformers, which in the film is described as the Allspark, as well as their home planet Cybertron. The film portrayed the Allspark as a large cube of energy that can create life from mechanical objects. During the Cybertronian Civil War, the Allspark was sent off the planet and eventually landed on Earth, where it was discovered by the U.S. government and the Hoover Dam was built over it as a top-secret research facility and government base. Megatron searched for the Allspark and eventually found Earth, but he crash-landed in the Arctic and was frozen. Many years later he was found and also brought to the same facility as the Allspark. With their homeworld ravaged by war, the Autobots were dispersed throughout space. But a group of Autobots led by Optimus Prime traveled to Earth in search of the Allspark, in an attempt to revitalize their planet. However, the Decepticons also race towards Earth to find the Allspark, as well as their leader, Megatron. The film depicts the battle over the Allspark on Earth. The Transformers are depicted as mechanical beings that can reconstruct their outside appearance through scanning or touching a mechanical object of relative size to each Transformer's body.[73] Steven Spielberg, who is credited as executive producer, said that Transformers is a dream come true because, he explains, since it started marketing the Toys conceived the idea of giving them life in a summer movie.
"And here's the movie," he says. "I must confess that I am a fan of Transformers since they left, rather than to buy them for my children, then bought the comics and toys." Spielberg, other producers had the same idea of bringing the Transformers movie, as the former studio executive Lorenzo DiBonaventura, as well as Hasbro's chief operating officer, Brian Goldner, among others. Spielberg and his team decided to find a director with sufficient skill and experience to take on the challenge of combining a fantastic story, special effects and lots of action. "I thought Michael (Bay) because I consider it perfect for Transformers. You need to touch and a clear vision of how it could be this film, "says Spielberg.
To market the film, IDW Publishing published Transformers: Movie Prequel. The comic expanded upon Optimus Prime's referral to Megatron as "brother", revealing they co-ruled Cybertron before Megatron's corruption. Furthermore, Optimus sent the Allspark into space in a last-ditch attempt to defeat Megatron. Megatron is responsible for Bumblebee's muteness in the film, as a direct result of distracting him from the Allspark's launch.[74] Alan Dean Foster also wrote the prequel novel Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday. The novel shows that Starscream hated Megatron and wanted him to never be found, so he could remain as leader, explaining Megatron's line in the film: "You failed me, yet again, Starscream." Blackout is also depicted as deeply loyal to Megatron, explaining his line "All hail Megatron!" However, the novel contradicts the film with Megatron's body moved into the Hoover Dam in 1969, instead of the 1930s.[75] IDW plans to continue the film's fictional universe with additional prequels and sequels.[76]
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, the sequel to the 2007 film, made its debut in theaters on June 24, 2009.
As a preemptive measure, Paramount and DreamWorks announced a July 1, 2011 release date for a third Transformers film before completion of Revenge of the Fallen. Bay responded, "I said I was taking off a year from Transformers. Paramount made a mistake in dating Transformers 3—they asked me on the phone—I said yes to July 1—but for 2012—whoops! Not 2011! That would mean I would have to start prep in September. No way. My brain needs a break from fighting robots." As in Revenge of the Fallen, Orci refused to guarantee whether he and Kurtzman would return to a sequel, because "we risk getting stale". Orci has mentioned he would like to introduce Unicron "for scale's sake". The co-writer also said focusing on more Triple Changers would be interesting.
On October 1, 2009, Michael Bay revealed that Transformers 3 had already gone into pre-production, and its planned release was back to its original date of July 1, 2011 instead of 2012. Also Ehren Kruger was said to be again involved in the writing, and Shia LaBeouf to reprise his roles as Sam. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, having written the first two movies, will not return for the third installment in the series.
In a hidden extra for the Blu-ray version of Revenge of the Fallen, Bay expressed his intention to make Transformers 3 not necessarily larger than Revenge of the Fallen, but instead go deeper into the mythos, give it more character development, and make it darker and more emotional. The video also shows images of Unicron.
[edit] Transformers Animated (2007 - 2009 / 2010)
Main article: Transformers Animated
The Cartoon Network-produced Transformers Animated is a cartoon that aired in early 2008.[77] Originally scheduled for late after 2007 under the title of Transformers: Heroes,[78] Transformers Animated is set in 2050 Detroit (after crash landing years earlier),[77] when robots and humans live side-by-side.[78] The Autobots come to Earth and assume superhero roles, battling evil humans with the Decepticons having a smaller role until Megatron resurfaces.[79] Main characters include Autobots Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Bulkhead, Prowl, Ratchet, Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Blitzwing, Lugnut, Blackarachnia, and human characters Professor Sumdac and Sari Sumdac. Several characters that were in the original Transformers cartoon and 1986 animated movie, as well as characters only seen in comics and such, make special appearances and cameos throughout the show. To mention a few: Soundwave, Wreck-Gar, Ironhide, Brawn, Rodimus, Oil Slick, Perceptor, Blackout, Strika, Spittor, Cyclonus, Metroplex, Red Alert, Hot Shot, Cliffjumper, Mainframe, Wheeljack, Alpha Trion, Warpath, and many more, as inside jokes and to please the fans.
[edit] Hunt for the Decepticons (2010-present)
In 2010, Hasbro released a toy line expansion to the film universe. This line is simply branded as Transformers and contains a promotion called "Hunt for the Decepticons". The promotion consists of a code number which collectors use to access online games on Transformers.com. The toy line consists of redecos and remolds of existing movie characters, as well as new versions of characters from Generation 1 and Generation 2.
Highlights in this toy line include Leader Class Starscream, Battle Ops Bumblebee and all-new redesigns of Voyager Class Optimus Prime and Deluxe Class Bumblebee.
[edit] Cyber Missions Webisodes
Main article: Transformers: Cyber Missions
[edit] Transformers: Prime/War for Cybertron (2010-present)
Main articles: Transformers: Exodus, Transformers: War for Cybertron, and Transformers: Prime
The video game War for Cybertron was released in 2010 and is said to be set in the same universe as the upcoming Transformers: Prime cartoon. War for Cybertron toys are set to be released, although the existence of Prime toys is still unconfirmed. The game has also inspired a book called Transformers: Exodus which consists of events leading up to the beginning of the game.
[edit] Official Convention and Collector's Club releases
An officially-recognized fan convention (usually called BotCon) has been held nearly every year since 1994. The first few conventions were organized by individual fans, but a fan-made company named 3H Enterprises (later Productions) secured the license to BotCon from 1997-2002. The license was secured by a new organization named Fun Publications in 2005, who have held it ever since.
Because the conventions are officially sanctioned by Hasbro, presenters have been able to produce official, limited-run toys, fiction, and other merchandise for sale at BotCon. The BotCon toys have grown dramatically over the years. In 1994, a single figure was provided for attendees. In 2010, fifteen different figures were available through a collection of box sets, souvenir packages, and customization classes.
Fictional contributions have also increased over the years. Prior to 2005, most conventions released a single comic, often accompanying the toys released that year. Since Fun Publications assumed the license, however, the annual BotCon comic has been supplemented by on-line text stories available exclusively at the official club website, and a bi-monthly magazine sent out to members with a six page comic in each issue. Grouped under the umbrella term "Transformers: Timelines", Fun Publications fiction deals with a variety of existing Transformers franchises, including Generation 1, Beast Wars and Cybertron, as well as new universes created specifically by Fun Publications such as TransTech and Shattered Glass.

This article is about the electrical device .  For the toy line franchise, see Transformers.  For other uses, see Transformer (disambiguation).





Pole-mounted power distribution transformer with center-tapped secondary winding (note use of grounded conductor, right, as one leg of the primary feeder). It transforms the high voltage of the overhead distribution wires to the lower voltage used in house wiring.


A transformer is a static device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through inductively coupled conductors—the transformer's coils. A varying current in the first or primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the transformer's core and thus a varying magnetic field through the secondary winding. This varying magnetic field induces a varying electromotive force (EMF) or "voltage" in the secondary winding. This effect is called mutual induction.
If a load is connected to the secondary, an electric current will flow in the secondary winding and electrical energy will be transferred from the primary circuit through the transformer to the load. In an ideal transformer, the induced voltage in the secondary winding (Vs) is in proportion to the primary voltage (Vp), and is given by the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary (Ns) to the number of turns in the primary (Np) as follows:



By appropriate selection of the ratio of turns, a transformer thus allows an alternating current (AC) voltage to be "stepped up" by making Ns greater than Np, or "stepped down" by making Ns less than Np.
In the vast majority of transformers, the windings are coils wound around a ferromagnetic core, air-core transformers being a notable exception.
Transformers range in size from a thumbnail-sized coupling transformer hidden inside a stage microphone to huge units weighing hundreds of tons used to interconnect portions of power grids. All operate with the same basic principles, although the range of designs is wide. While new technologies have eliminated the need for transformers in some electronic circuits, transformers are still found in nearly all electronic devices designed for household ("mains") voltage. Transformers are essential for high-voltage electric power transmission, which makes long-distance transmission economically practical.

[edit] History
[edit] Discovery




Faraday's experiment with induction between coils of wire [1]


The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction was discovered independently by Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry in 1831. However, Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments and thus receive credit for the discovery.[2] The relationship between electromotive force (EMF) or "voltage" and magnetic flux was formalized in an equation now referred to as "Faraday's law of induction":

.

where  is the magnitude of the EMF in volts and ΦB is the magnetic flux through the circuit (in webers).[3]
Faraday performed the first experiments on induction between coils of wire, including winding a pair of coils around an iron ring, thus creating the first toroidal closed-core transformer.[4]
[edit] Induction coils




Faraday's ring transformer


The first type of transformer to see wide use was the induction coil, invented by Rev. Nicholas Callan of Maynooth College, Ireland in 1836. He was one of the first researchers to realize that the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger is the increase in EMF. Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce direct current (DC) rather than alternating current (AC), induction coils relied upon vibrating electrical contacts that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.
In 1876, Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of alternating current and the secondary windings could be connected to several "electric candles" (arc lamps) of his own design.[5][6] The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.[5]
In 1878, the Ganz Company in Hungary began manufacturing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their systems used alternating current exclusively and included those comprising both arc and incandescent lamps, along with generators and other equipment.[7]
Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs first exhibited a device with an open iron core called a "secondary generator" in London in 1882, then sold the idea to the Westinghouse company in the United States.[8] They also exhibited the invention in Turin, Italy in 1884, where it was adopted for an electric lighting system.[9] However, the efficiency of their open-core bipolar apparatus remained very low.[10]
Induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient for transfer of power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.[11]
Efficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade the transformer would be instrumental in the "War of Currents", and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.[12]
[edit] Closed-core lighting transformers




Drawing of Ganz Company's 1885 prototype. Capacity: 1400 VA, frequency: 40 Hz, voltage ratio: 120/72 V






Prototypes of the world's first high-efficiency transformers. They were built by the Z.B.D. team on 16th September 1884.[13]


In the autumn of 1884[14], Ganz Company engineers Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage. In their joint patent application for the "Z.B.D." transformers, they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits: the "closed-core" and "shell-core" transformers. In the closed-core, the primary and secondary windings were wound around a closed iron ring; in the shell-core, the windings were passed through the iron core. In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the iron core, with no intentional path through air. The new Z.B.D. transformers reached 98 percent efficiency, which was 3.4 times higher than the open core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibs.[15] When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces.[16][17] Bláthy had suggested the use of closed-cores, Zipernowsky the use of shunt connections, and Déri had performed the experiments;[18] Bláthy also discovered the transformer formula, Vs/Vp = Ns/Np.[citation needed] The vast majority of transformers in use today rely on the basic principles discovered by the three engineers. They also reportedly popularized the word "transformer" to describe a device for altering the EMF of an electric current,[16][19] although the term had already been in use by 1882.[20][21] In 1886, the Ganz Company installed the world's first power station that used AC generators to power a parallel-connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.[22]




Stanley's 1886 design for adjustable gap open-core induction coils[23]


Although George Westinghouse had bought Gaulard and Gibbs' patents in 1885, the Edison Electric Light Company held an option on the U.S. rights for the Z.B.D. transformers, requiring Westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles. He assigned to William Stanley the task of developing a device for commercial use in United States.[24] Stanley's first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the EMF present in the secondary winding. (See drawing at left.)[23] This design was first used commercially in the U.S. in 1886.[12] But Westinghouse soon had his team working on a design whose core comprised a stack of thin "E-shaped" iron plates, separated individually or in pairs by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material. Prewound copper coils could then be slid into place, and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit. Westinghouse applied for a patent for the new design in December 1886; it was granted in July 1887.[18][25]
[edit] Other early transformers
In 1889, Russian-born engineer Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky developed the first three-phase transformer at the Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft ("General Electricity Company") in Germany.[26]
In 1891, Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla coil, an air-cored, dual-tuned resonant transformer for generating very high voltages at high frequency.[27][28]
Audio frequency transformers ("repeating coils") were used by early experimenters in the development of the telephone.[citation needed]
[edit] Basic principles
The transformer is based on two principles: first, that an electric current can produce a magnetic field (electromagnetism), and, second that a changing magnetic field within a coil of wire induces a voltage across the ends of the coil (electromagnetic induction). Changing the current in the primary coil changes the magnetic flux that is developed. The changing magnetic flux induces a voltage in the secondary coil.




An ideal transformer


An ideal transformer is shown in the adjacent figure. Current passing through the primary coil creates a magnetic field. The primary and secondary coils are wrapped around a core of very high magnetic permeability, such as iron, so that most of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary coils.
[edit] Induction law
The voltage induced across the secondary coil may be calculated from Faraday's law of induction, which states that:

where Vs is the instantaneous voltage, Ns is the number of turns in the secondary coil and Φ is the magnetic flux through one turn of the coil. If the turns of the coil are oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, the flux is the product of the magnetic flux density B and the area A through which it cuts. The area is constant, being equal to the cross-sectional area of the transformer core, whereas the magnetic field varies with time according to the excitation of the primary. Since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary coils in an ideal transformer,[29] the instantaneous voltage across the primary winding equals



Taking the ratio of the two equations for Vs and Vp gives the basic equation[30] for stepping up or stepping down the voltage



Np/Ns is known as the turns ratio, and is the primary functional characteristic of any transformer. In the case of step-up transformers, this may sometimes be stated as the reciprocal, Ns/Np. Turns ratio is commonly expressed as an irreducible fraction or ratio: for example, a transformer with primary and secondary windings of, respectively, 100 and 150 turns is said to have a turns ratio of 2:3 rather than 0.667 or 100:150.
[edit] Ideal power equation




The ideal transformer as a circuit element


If the secondary coil is attached to a load that allows current to flow, electrical power is transmitted from the primary circuit to the secondary circuit. Ideally, the transformer is perfectly efficient; all the incoming energy is transformed from the primary circuit to the magnetic field and into the secondary circuit. If this condition is met, the incoming electric power must equal the outgoing power:



giving the ideal transformer equation



Transformers normally have high efficiency, so this formula is a reasonable approximation.
If the voltage is increased, then the current is decreased by the same factor. The impedance in one circuit is transformed by the square of the turns ratio.[29] For example, if an impedance Zs is attached across the terminals of the secondary coil, it appears to the primary circuit to have an impedance of (Np/Ns)2Zs. This relationship is reciprocal, so that the impedance Zp of the primary circuit appears to the secondary to be (Ns/Np)2Zp.
[edit] Detailed operation
The simplified description above neglects several practical factors, in particular the primary current required to establish a magnetic field in the core, and the contribution to the field due to current in the secondary circuit.
Models of an ideal transformer typically assume a core of negligible reluctance with two windings of zero resistance.[31] When a voltage is applied to the primary winding, a small current flows, driving flux around the magnetic circuit of the core.[31] The current required to create the flux is termed the magnetizing current; since the ideal core has been assumed to have near-zero reluctance, the magnetizing current is negligible, although still required to create the magnetic field.
The changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) across each winding.[32] Since the ideal windings have no impedance, they have no associated voltage drop, and so the voltages VP and VS measured at the terminals of the transformer, are equal to the corresponding EMFs. The primary EMF, acting as it does in opposition to the primary voltage, is sometimes termed the "back EMF".[33] This is due to Lenz's law which states that the induction of EMF would always be such that it will oppose development of any such change in magnetic field.

The ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.[34] Such flux is termed leakage flux, and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings.[33] Leakage results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss (see "Stray losses" below), but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage to fail to be directly proportional to the primary, particularly under heavy load.[34] Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.
However, in some applications, leakage can be a desirable property, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may be deliberately introduced to a transformer's design to limit the short-circuit current it will supply.[33] Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit negative resistance, such as electric arcs, mercury vapor lamps, and neon signs; or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as electric arc welders.[35]
Air gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a direct current flowing through the windings.[citation needed]
Leakage inductance is also helpful when transformers are operated in parallel. It can be shown that if the "per-unit" inductance of two transformers is the same (a typical value is 5%), they will automatically split power "correctly" (e.g. 500 kVA unit in parallel with 1,000 kVA unit, the larger one will carry twice the current).[citation needed]
[edit] Effect of frequency

 Transformer universal EMF equation
If the flux in the core is purely sinusoidal, the relationship for either winding between its rms voltage Erms of the winding , and the supply frequency f, number of turns N, core cross-sectional area a and peak magnetic flux density B is given by the universal EMF equation:[31]

If the flux does not contain even harmonics the following equation can be used for half-cycle average voltage Eavg of any waveshape:


The time-derivative term in Faraday's Law shows that the flux in the core is the integral with respect to time of the applied voltage.[36] Hypothetically an ideal transformer would work with direct-current excitation, with the core flux increasing linearly with time.[37] In practice, the flux would rise to the point where magnetic saturation of the core occurs, causing a huge increase in the magnetizing current and overheating the transformer. All practical transformers must therefore operate with alternating (or pulsed) current.[37]
The EMF of a transformer at a given flux density increases with frequency.[31] By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400&#160;Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.[38] Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g. 16.7 Hz and 25 Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50 – 60 Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors. As such, the transformers used to step down the high over-head line voltages (e.g. 15 kV) are much heavier for the same power rating than those designed only for the higher frequencies.
Operation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current; at lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. For example, transformers may need to be equipped with "volts per hertz" over-excitation relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.
One example of state-of-the-art design is those transformers used for electric multiple unit high speed trains, particularly those required to operate across the borders of countries using different standards of electrification. The position of such transformers is restricted to being hung below the passenger compartment. They have to function at different frequencies (down to 16.7 Hz) and voltages (up to 25 kV) whilst handling the enhanced power requirements needed for operating the trains at high speed.
Knowledge of natural frequencies of transformer windings is of importance for the determination of the transient response of the windings to impulse and switching surge voltages.

[edit] Energy losses
An ideal transformer would have no energy losses, and would be 100% efficient. In practical transformers energy is dissipated in the windings, core, and surrounding structures. Larger transformers are generally more efficient, and those rated for electricity distribution usually perform better than 98%.[39]
Experimental transformers using superconducting windings achieve efficiencies of 99.85%.[40] The increase in efficiency from about 98 to 99.85% can save considerable energy, and hence money, in a large heavily-loaded transformer; the trade-off is in the additional initial and running cost of the superconducting design.
Losses in transformers (excluding associated circuitry) vary with load current, and may be expressed as "no-load" or "full-load" loss. Winding resistance dominates load losses, whereas hysteresis and eddy currents losses contribute to over 99% of the no-load loss. The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply and a running cost; designing transformers for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality silicon steel, or even amorphous steel, for the core, and thicker wire, increasing initial cost, so that there is a trade-off between initial cost and running cost. (Also see energy efficient transformer).[41]
Transformer losses are divided into losses in the windings, termed copper loss, and those in the magnetic circuit, termed iron loss. Losses in the transformer arise from:

Winding resistance
Current flowing through the windings causes resistive heating of the conductors. At higher frequencies, skin effect and proximity effect create additional winding resistance and losses.
Hysteresis losses
Each time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core. For a given core material, the loss is proportional to the frequency, and is a function of the peak flux density to which it is subjected.[41]
Eddy currents
Ferromagnetic materials are also good conductors, and a core made from such a material also constitutes a single short-circuited turn throughout its entire length. Eddy currents therefore circulate within the core in a plane normal to the flux, and are responsible for resistive heating of the core material. The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness.[41] Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of plates electrically insulated from each other, rather than a solid block; all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores.
Magnetostriction
Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material, such as the core, causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as magnetostriction. This produces the buzzing sound commonly associated with transformers,[30] and can cause losses due to frictional heating.
Mechanical losses
In addition to magnetostriction, the alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings. These incite vibrations within nearby metalwork, adding to the buzzing noise, and consuming a small amount of power.[42]
Stray losses



Leakage inductance is by itself largely lossless, since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is returned to the supply with the next half-cycle. However, any leakage flux that intercepts nearby conductive materials such as the transformer's support structure will give rise to eddy currents and be converted to heat.[43] There are also radiative losses due to the oscillating magnetic field, but these are usually small.

[edit] Dot convention
Main article: Dot convention
It is common in transformer schematic symbols for there to be a dot at the end of each coil within a transformer, particularly for transformers with multiple primary and secondary windings. The dots indicate the direction of each winding relative to the others. Voltages at the dot end of each winding are in phase; current flowing into the dot end of a primary coil will result in current flowing out of the dot end of a secondary coil.
[edit] Equivalent circuit

Refer to the diagram below

The physical limitations of the practical transformer may be brought together as an equivalent circuit model (shown below) built around an ideal lossless transformer.[44] Power loss in the windings is current-dependent and is represented as in-series resistances Rp and Rs. Flux leakage results in a fraction of the applied voltage dropped without contributing to the mutual coupling, and thus can be modeled as reactances of each leakage inductance Xp and Xs in series with the perfectly coupled region.
Iron losses are caused mostly by hysteresis and eddy current effects in the core, and are proportional to the square of the core flux for operation at a given frequency.[45] Since the core flux is proportional to the applied voltage, the iron loss can be represented by a resistance RC in parallel with the ideal transformer.
A core with finite permeability requires a magnetizing current Im to maintain the mutual flux in the core. The magnetizing current is in phase with the flux; saturation effects cause the relationship between the two to be non-linear, but for simplicity this effect tends to be ignored in most circuit equivalents.[45] With a sinusoidal supply, the core flux lags the induced EMF by 90° and this effect can be modeled as a magnetizing reactance (reactance of an effective inductance) Xm in parallel with the core loss component. Rc and Xm are sometimes together termed the magnetizing branch of the model. If the secondary winding is made open-circuit, the current I0 taken by the magnetizing branch represents the transformer's no-load current.[44]
The secondary impedance Rs and Xs is frequently moved (or "referred") to the primary side after multiplying the components by the impedance scaling factor (Np/Ns)2.





Transformer equivalent circuit, with secondary impedances referred to the primary side


The resulting model is sometimes termed the "exact equivalent circuit", though it retains a number of approximations, such as an assumption of linearity.[44] Analysis may be simplified by moving the magnetizing branch to the left of the primary impedance, an implicit assumption that the magnetizing current is low, and then summing primary and referred secondary impedances, resulting in so-called equivalent impedance.
The parameters of equivalent circuit of a transformer can be calculated from the results of two transformer tests: open-circuit test and short-circuit test.
[edit] Types
For more details on this topic, see Transformer types.
A wide variety of transformer designs are used for different applications, though they share several common features. Important common transformer types include:
[edit] Autotransformer
Main article: Autotransformer




An autotransformer with a sliding brush contact


An autotransformer has a single winding with two end terminals, and one or more terminals at intermediate tap points. The primary voltage is applied across two of the terminals, and the secondary voltage taken from two terminals, almost always having one terminal in common with the primary voltage. The primary and secondary circuits therefore have a number of windings turns in common.[46] Since the volts-per-turn is the same in both windings, each develops a voltage in proportion to its number of turns. In an autotransformer part of the current flows directly from the input to the output, and only part is transferred inductively, allowing a smaller, lighter, cheaper core to be used as well as requiring only a single winding[47]. However, a transformer with separate windings isolates the primary from the secondary, which is safer when using mains voltages.
An adjustable autotransformer is made by exposing part of the winding coils and making the secondary connection through a sliding brush, giving a variable turns ratio.[48] Such a device is often referred to as a variac.
Autotransformers are often used to step up or down between voltages in the 110-117-120 volt range and voltages in the 220-230-240 volt range, e.g., to output either 110 or 120V (with taps) from 230V input, allowing equipment from a 100 or 120V region to be used in a 230V region.
[edit] Polyphase transformers
For more details on this topic, see Three-phase electric power.




Three-phase step-down transformer mounted between two utility poles


For three-phase supplies, a bank of three individual single-phase transformers can be used, or all three phases can be incorporated as a single three-phase transformer. In this case, the magnetic circuits are connected together, the core thus containing a three-phase flow of flux.[49] A number of winding configurations are possible, giving rise to different attributes and phase shifts.[50] One particular polyphase configuration is the zigzag transformer, used for grounding and in the suppression of harmonic currents.[51]

[edit] Leakage transformers




Leakage transformer


A leakage transformer, also called a stray-field transformer, has a significantly higher leakage inductance than other transformers, sometimes increased by a magnetic bypass or shunt in its core between primary and secondary, which is sometimes adjustable with a set screw. This provides a transformer with an inherent current limitation due to the loose coupling between its primary and the secondary windings. The output and input currents are low enough to prevent thermal overload under all load conditions—even if the secondary is shorted.
Leakage transformers are used for arc welding and high voltage discharge lamps (neon lights and cold cathode fluorescent lamps, which are series-connected up to 7.5&#160;kV AC). It acts then both as a voltage transformer and as a magnetic ballast.
Other applications are short-circuit-proof extra-low voltage transformers for toys or doorbell installations.
[edit] Resonant transformers
Main article: resonant energy transfer
A resonant transformer is a kind of leakage transformer. It uses the leakage inductance of its secondary windings in combination with external capacitors, to create one or more resonant circuits. Resonant transformers such as the Tesla coil can generate very high voltages, and are able to provide much higher current than electrostatic high-voltage generation machines such as the Van de Graaff generator.[52] One of the applications of the resonant transformer is for the CCFL inverter. Another application of the resonant transformer is to couple between stages of a superheterodyne receiver, where the selectivity of the receiver is provided by tuned transformers in the intermediate-frequency amplifiers.[53]
[edit] Audio transformers
Main article: Audio transformers
Audio transformers are those specifically designed for use in audio circuits. They can be used to block radio frequency interference or the DC component of an audio signal, to split or combine audio signals, or to provide impedance matching between high and low impedance circuits, such as between a high impedance tube (valve) amplifier output and a low impedance loudspeaker, or between a high impedance instrument output and the low impedance input of a mixing console.
Such transformers were originally designed to connect different telephone systems to one another while keeping their respective power supplies isolated, and are still commonly used to interconnect professional audio systems or system components.
Being magnetic devices, audio transformers are susceptible to external magnetic fields such as those generated by AC current-carrying conductors. "Hum" is a term commonly used to describe unwanted signals originating from the "mains" power supply (typically 50 or 60 Hz). Audio transformers used for low-level signals, such as those from microphones, often include shielding to protect against extraneous magnetically coupled signals.
[edit] Instrument transformers
Instrument transformers are used for measuring voltage and current in electrical power systems, and for power system protection and control. Where a voltage or current is too large to be conveniently used by an instrument, it can be scaled down to a standardized, low value. Instrument transformers isolate measurement, protection and control circuitry from the high currents or voltages present on the circuits being measured or controlled.




Current transformers, designed for placing around conductors


A current transformer is a transformer designed to provide a current in its secondary coil proportional to the current flowing in its primary coil.[54]
Voltage transformers (VTs), also referred to as "potential transformers" (PTs), are designed to have an accurately known transformation ratio in both magnitude and phase, over a range of measuring circuit impedances. A voltage transformer is intended to present a negligible load to the supply being measured. The low secondary voltage allows protective relay equipment and measuring instruments to be operated at a lower voltages.[55]
Both current and voltage instrument transformers are designed to have predictable characteristics on overloads. Proper operation of over-current protective relays requires that current transformers provide a predictable transformation ratio even during a short-circuit.
[edit] Classification
Transformers can be classified in many different ways; an incomplete list is:

By power capacity: from a fraction of a volt-ampere (VA) to over a thousand MVA;
By frequency range: power-, audio-, or radio frequency;
By voltage class: from a few volts to hundreds of kilovolts;
By cooling type: air-cooled, oil-filled, fan-cooled, or water-cooled;
By application: such as power supply, impedance matching, output voltage and current stabilizer, or circuit isolation;
By purpose: distribution, rectifier, arc furnace, amplifier output, etc.;
By winding turns ratio: step-up, step-down, isolating with equal or near-equal ratio, variable, multiple windings.


[edit] Construction
[edit] Cores




Laminated core transformer showing edge of laminations at top of photo


[edit] Laminated steel cores
Transformers for use at power or audio frequencies typically have cores made of high permeability silicon steel.[56] The steel has a permeability many times that of free space, and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current, and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings.[57] Early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy-current losses, and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires.[8] Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use. Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.[49] The universal transformer equation indicates a minimum cross-sectional area for the core to avoid saturation.
The effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux, and so reduce their magnitude. Thinner laminations reduce losses,[56] but are more laborious and expensive to construct.[58] Thin laminations are generally used on high frequency transformers, with some types of very thin steel laminations able to operate up to 10&#160;kHz.




Laminating the core greatly reduces eddy-current losses


One common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of E-shaped steel sheets capped with I-shaped pieces, leading to its name of "E-I transformer".[58] Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap.[58] They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.
A steel core's remanence means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed. When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high inrush current until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied alternating current.[59] Overcurrent protection devices such as fuses must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass. On transformers connected to long, overhead power transmission lines, induced currents due to geomagnetic disturbances during solar storms can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices.[60]
Distribution transformers can achieve low no-load losses by using cores made with low-loss high-permeability silicon steel or amorphous (non-crystalline) metal alloy. The higher initial cost of the core material is offset over the life of the transformer by its lower losses at light load.[61]
[edit] Solid cores
Powdered iron cores are used in circuits (such as switch-mode power supplies) that operate above main frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical resistivity. For frequencies extending beyond the VHF band, cores made from non-conductive magnetic ceramic materials called ferrites are common.[58] Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the coupling coefficient (and bandwidth) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.
[edit] Toroidal cores




Small toroidal core transformer


Toroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of silicon steel or permalloy wound into a coil, powdered iron, or ferrite.[62] A strip construction ensures that the grain boundaries are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's reluctance. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.[35] The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed, and also provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating electromagnetic interference.
Toroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see "Classification" above). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.
Ferrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of switch-mode power supplies. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers are uncommon above ratings of a few kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.
[edit] Air cores
A physical core is not an absolute requisite and a functioning transformer can be produced simply by placing the windings near each other, an arrangement termed an "air-core" transformer. The air which comprises the magnetic circuit is essentially lossless, and so an air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.[33] The leakage inductance is inevitably high, resulting in very poor regulation, and so such designs are unsuitable for use in power distribution.[33] They have however very high bandwidth, and are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications,[63] for which a satisfactory coupling coefficient is maintained by carefully overlapping the primary and secondary windings. They're also used for resonant transformers such as Tesla coils where they can achieve reasonably low loss in spite of the high leakage inductance.
[edit] Windings




Windings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage.

Top left: Toroidal transformer. Right: C-core, but E-core would be similar. The black windings are made of film. Top: Equally low capacitance between all ends of both windings. Since most cores are at least moderately conductive they also need insulation. Bottom: Lowest capacitance for one end of the secondary winding needed for low-power high-voltage transformers. Bottom left: Reduction of leakage inductance would lead to increase of capacitance.


The conducting material used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn.[36] For small power and signal transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from enamelled magnet wire, such as Formvar wire. Larger power transformers operating at high voltages may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil-impregnated paper and blocks of pressboard.[64]
High-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided Litz wire to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses.[36] Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings.[64] Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.[64]
For signal transformers, the windings may be arranged in a way to minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. This can be done by splitting up each coil into sections, and those sections placed in layers between the sections of the other winding. This is known as a stacked type or interleaved winding.
Both the primary and secondary windings on power transformers may have external connections, called taps, to intermediate points on the winding to allow selection of the voltage ratio. In distribution transformers the taps may be connected to an automatic on-load tap changer for voltage regulation of distribution circuits. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A center-tapped transformer is often used in the output stage of an audio power amplifier in a push-pull circuit. Modulation transformers in AM transmitters are very similar.
Certain transformers have the windings protected by epoxy resin. By impregnating the transformer with epoxy under a vacuum, one can replace air spaces within the windings with epoxy, thus sealing the windings and helping to prevent the possible formation of corona and absorption of dirt or water. This produces transformers more suited to damp or dirty environments, but at increased manufacturing cost.[65]
[edit] Coolant




Cut-away view of three-phase oil-cooled transformer. The oil reservoir is visible at the top. Radiative fins aid the dissipation of heat.


High temperatures will damage the winding insulation.[66] Small transformers do not generate significant heat and are cooled by air circulation and radiation of heat. Power transformers rated up to several hundred kVA can be adequately cooled by natural convective air-cooling, sometimes assisted by fans.[67] In larger transformers, part of the design problem is removal of heat. Some power transformers are immersed in transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings.[68] The oil is a highly refined mineral oil that remains stable at transformer operating temperature. Indoor liquid-filled transformers are required by building regulations in many jurisdictions to use a non-flammable liquid, or to be located in fire-resistant rooms.[69] Air-cooled dry transformers are preferred for indoor applications even at capacity ratings where oil-cooled construction would be more economical, because their cost is offset by the reduced building construction cost.
The oil-filled tank often has radiators through which the oil circulates by natural convection; some large transformers employ forced circulation of the oil by electric pumps, aided by external fans or water-cooled heat exchangers.[68] Oil-filled transformers undergo prolonged drying processes to ensure that the transformer is completely free of water vapor before the cooling oil is introduced. This helps prevent electrical breakdown under load. Oil-filled transformers may be equipped with Buchholz relays, which detect gas evolved during internal arcing and rapidly de-energize the transformer to avert catastrophic failure.[59] Oil-filled transformers may fail, rupture, and burn, causing power outages and losses. Installations of oil-filled transformers usually includes fire protection measures such as walls, oil containment, and fire-suppression sprinkler systems.
Polychlorinated biphenyls have properties that once favored their use as a coolant, though concerns over their environmental persistence led to a widespread ban on their use.[70] Today, non-toxic, stable silicone-based oils, or fluorinated hydrocarbons may be used where the expense of a fire-resistant liquid offsets additional building cost for a transformer vault.[66][69] Before 1977, even transformers that were nominally filled only with mineral oils may also have been contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls at 10-20 ppm. Since mineral oil and PCB fluid mix, maintenance equipment used for both PCB and oil-filled transformers could carry over small amounts of PCB, contaminating oil-filled transformers.[71]
Some "dry" transformers (containing no liquid) are enclosed in sealed, pressurized tanks and cooled by nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride gas.[66]
Experimental power transformers in the 2&#160;MVA range have been built with superconducting windings which eliminates the copper losses, but not the core steel loss. These are cooled by liquid nitrogen or helium.[72]
[edit] Insulation drying





This section does not cite any references or sources.

Construction of oil-filled transformers requires that the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried before the oil is introduced. There are several different methods of drying. Common for all is that they are carried out in vacuum environment. The vacuum makes it difficult to transfer energy (heat) to the insulation. For this there are several different methods. The traditional drying is done by circulating hot air over the active part and cycle this with periods of vacuum (hot-air vacuum drying, HAV). More common for larger transformers is to use evaporated solvent which condenses on the colder active part. The benefit is that the entire process can be carried out at lower pressure and without influence of added oxygen. This process is commonly called vapour-phase drying (VPD).
For distribution transformers, which are smaller and have a smaller insulation weight, resistance heating can be used. This is a method where current is injected in the windings to heat the insulation. The benefit is that the heating can be controlled very well and it is energy efficient. The method is called low-frequency heating (LFH) since the current is injected at a much lower frequency than the nominal of the grid, which is normally 50 or 60 Hz. A lower frequency reduces the effect of the inductance in the transformer, so the voltage can be reduced.
[edit] Terminals
Very small transformers will have wire leads connected directly to the ends of the coils, and brought out to the base of the unit for circuit connections. Larger transformers may have heavy bolted terminals, bus bars or high-voltage insulated bushings made of polymers or porcelain. A large bushing can be a complex structure since it must provide careful control of the electric field gradient without letting the transformer leak oil.[73]
[edit] Applications

A major application of transformers is to increase voltage before transmitting electrical energy over long distances through wires. Wires have resistance and so dissipate electrical energy at a rate proportional to the square of the current through the wire. By transforming electrical power to a high-voltage (and therefore low-current) form for transmission and back again afterward, transformers enable economical transmission of power over long distances. Consequently, transformers have shaped the electricity supply industry, permitting generation to be located remotely from points of demand.[74] All but a tiny fraction of the world's electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer.[43]
Transformers are also used extensively in electronic products to step down the supply voltage to a level suitable for the low voltage circuits they contain. The transformer also electrically isolates the end user from contact with the supply voltage.
Signal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of amplifiers and to match devices such as microphones and record players to the input of amplifiers. Audio transformers allowed telephone circuits to carry on a two-way conversation over a single pair of wires. A balun transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has balanced voltages to ground, such as between external cables and internal circuits.
The principle of open-circuit (unloaded) transformer is widely used for characterisation of soft magnetic materials, for example in the internationally standardised Epstein frame method[75].

Super Bowl Trailer
Video + Screen Caps  - In case you missed the main event for us fans earlier tonight, a new Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon teaser trailer debuted during the 2nd quarter of the Super Bowl. For your viewing pleasure, we have posted a gallery showcasing every single moment you could want to see from the 30 second clip. Check out all 213 screen captures as well as the trailer itself by clicking here. Let us know what you thought of the trailer on our message board.							




 

TF Infestation #1 Reviewed
The Walking Dead  - IDW introduces a single element to its existing titles which gives us zombies and vampires introduced to the Autobot and Decepticon war (much like they have been introduced into many other mainstream companies titles over the last year), as well as the individual universes of Star Trek, G.I.Joe, and Ghostbusters. The main characters in each brand never actually crossover with one another, but the events themselves do, starting out with an introduction in INFESTATION #1, and then continuing its events into the four main titles' respective individual universes. Read our full review here and share your thoughts about this title.							




 

RTS Deluxe Wave 2 Galleries
Autobots  - Now that you've finally caught your breath after going through our new galleries for Generations Kup and Scourge, our fearless leader Ryan gives us more of the good stuff. This time, we bring you four fantastic new galleries from the Reveal the Shield line: Wreck-Gar, Perceptor, Optimus Prime (G2), and Bumblebee. Hopefully these galleries will tide you over until you can track them down if you're still itching for these to show up on a store shelf near you.							




 

Twincast / Podcast #12
Crash Test 'Cons  - Are you perhaps wondering what the deal is with the Twincast Episode 12 title? It couldn't possibly have to do with an important announcement regarding everyone's favorite yearly Transformers event, could it? Our advice is to bend your ear with the sweet digital resonance of our charming voices for an hour or so. By the end, you'll be treated to information you've no doubt already heard except this time it will be peppered with our endearing (and free) opinions. We also discuss a few other toy related topics, doing our regular take on TF history, and even answer another listener question.							




 

TFA Stunticons @ BotCon 2011
Crush! Destroy!  - Believe it or not, true believers, BotCon 2011 is only a little over 4 months away! The first of several exclusives from this years convention has been revealed, as well as the overall theme of this year's boxset which will be Transformers Animated Stunticons. Love or it hate it, this set has already got Seibertronians hotly debating this concept. Tell us your thoughts by joining our discussion here.

MTV Michael Bay Interview &quot;We Worked Extra Hard&quot;
Posted February 11th, 2011 at 12:23am by El Duque
MTV caught up with Michael Bay,director of the live action Transformer films, on the red carpet for a quick interview about the third installment of the franchise Tansformers: Dark of the Moon. The interview can be found at MTV Movies Blog.

"We just have, I think, a better story," he said. "It's epic and it happens in a city, so it's more accessible because you recognize stuff; it's not in a desert. It's kind of like 'Black Hawk Down' with our small group of heroes in a city."

Transformers is a 2007 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line. The film, which combines computer animation with live-action, is directed by Michael Bay and produced by Steven Spielberg. It stars Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, a teenager involved in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery. The Decepticons desire control of the All Spark, the object that created their robotic race, with the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth. Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and John Turturro also star, while voice-actors Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving voice Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively.
Producers Don Murphy and Tom DeSanto developed the project in 2003, with a treatment written by DeSanto. Executive producer Steven Spielberg came on board the following year, hiring Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The United States Military and General Motors (GM) loaned vehicles and aircraft during filming, which saved money for the production and added realism to the battle scenes. Hasbro organized an enormous promotional campaign for the film, making deals with hundreds of companies. This advertising blitz included a viral marketing campaign, coordinated releases of prequel comic books, toys and books, as well as product placement deals with GM and eBay.
Transformers was a box office success[2] despite mixed critical reaction to the radical redesigns of the characters, and reviews criticizing the focus on the humans at the expense of the robots. It is the thirty-seventh most successful film released and the fifth most successful of 2007, grossing approximately US$709 million worldwide. The film won four awards from the Visual Effects Society and was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing.
The film spawned a sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, which was released on June 24, 2009 to negative reviews but was a commercial success and grossed more than its predecessor. A third and final film is set to release on July 1, 2011 in 3-D.

Plot
Optimus Prime, heroic leader of the benevolent Autobots, describes in a voice-over the shutdown of the Transformers' home world, Cybertron. It was destroyed by the malevolent Decepticon leader Megatron in his quest to get hold of the All Spark. The Autobots want to find the All Spark so they can use it to rebuild Cybertron and end the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, while the Decepticons want to use it to obliterate the Autobots and take over the universe. Megatron had managed to locate the All Spark on Earth, but crash-landed in the Arctic Circle and froze in the ice. After stumbling upon his frozen body in 1897, explorer Captain Archibald Witwicky accidentally activated Megatron's navigational system and his eye glasses were imprinted with the coordinates of the All Spark's location, an incident that left him blind and mentally unstable. Sector 7, a secret government organization created by President Herbert Hoover, discovered the All Spark in the Colorado River and built the Hoover Dam around it to mask its energy emissions. The still-frozen Megatron was moved into this facility and was used to advance human technology through reverse engineering.
In the present day, a group of Decepticons composed of Blackout, Scorponok, Frenzy, Barricade, Starscream, Brawl and Bonecrusher, have landed on Earth and assumed the disguise of Earth vehicles. Blackout and Scorponok attack the U.S. SOCCENT forward operations base in Qatar and try to hack into the U.S. Military network to find the location of Megatron and the All Spark. Their mission is thwarted when the base staff cuts the network cable connections. While Blackout destroys the rest of the base, Scorponok pursues a small group of survivors, led by Captain William Lennox and Sergeant Robert Epps, who have photographic evidence of the robots. Scorponok is eventually repelled and hides in the sand after the humans manage to call air support and damage his tail. During this battle, the military discovers the only effective weapons against the Decepticons' armor are high-heat sabot rounds.
After Blackout's failure, Frenzy infiltrates Air Force One to again hack into the military network, planting a computer virus. He finds the map imprinted on Captain Witwicky's glasses. While the Pentagon interferes with Frenzy's plan, he finds that Witwicky's descendant Sam Witwicky intends to sell the glasses on eBay. Frenzy and Barricade begin tracking Sam's location. Meanwhile, Sam unknowingly buys the Autobot scout Bumblebee (also on Earth disguised as a 1976 Camaro[3]) as his first car. After Bumblebee helps Sam woo his crush, Mikaela Banes, he leaves at night to transmit a homing signal to the rest of the Autobots. Sam pursues Bumblebee, thinking someone is stealing his car, but is shocked to find his car is actually a giant robot, which he regards as evil as first. Sam then gets arrested, and in the police station, tries to explain to the police officer what happened, but the apathetic and impassive officer just assumes that he is hallucinating under the influence of drugs. When Bumblebee (in car mode) returns the following day, Sam flees, believing the car is stalking him. While out, Barricade attacks Sam and ferociously interrogates him about his grandfather's glasses. Bumblebee saves Sam and Mikaela and engages Barricade in battle. During the fight, Mikaela severs Frenzy's head but he transforms into her cellphone and hides in her purse. They leave to meet with the rest of the Autobot team—Optimus Prime, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet—who have landed on Earth and taken the forms of Earth vehicles as well. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots return to Sam's home and obtain the glasses; however, agents from Sector 7 arrive and take Sam and Mikaela into custody. The Autobots intervene, but Sector 7 captures Bumblebee and sends Sam and Mikaela away.
Sam and Mikaela are taken to Hoover Dam, as are Lennox and Epps, under Defense Secretary John Keller's orders. Frenzy sends an alert to the other Decepticons and sneaks into the technology system, freeing Megatron from his frozen state. Sam convinces the Sector 7 agents to release Bumblebee so that he can deliver the All Spark to Optimus. Frenzy's hacking has shut down government communications, but Keller and two hackers, Maggie and Glen, manage to establish a signal to the Air Force in order to support the Autobot-human convoy that has gone to nearby Mission City to hide the All Spark. The Decepticons attack; Bonecrusher, Frenzy, Jazz, Brawl, Barricade and Blackout are all killed during the ensuing battle. Sam, who was instructed to put the All Spark into Optimus' chest if Megatron prevailed (thereby destroying it and Optimus), instead rams the All Spark cube into Megatron's chest. The All Spark disintegrates, and its power obliterates Megatron. Optimus takes a fragment of the All Spark from Megatron's corpse, but admits that with its destruction, their home world Cybertron cannot be restored. The government orders the closure of Sector 7 and has the destroyed Megatron and other Decepticons dumped into the Laurentian Abyss. Lennox and Epps are reunited with their families, and Sam and Mikaela form a relationship. Optimus transmits a message to all surviving Autobots in space, telling them that they have a new home on Earth. During the credits, Starscream—the only surviving Decepticon besides Scorponok—escapes into space to tell the true leader of the Decepticons The Fallen of what has happened.

"In all the years of movie-making, I don't think the image of a truck transforming into a twenty-foot tall robot has ever been captured on screen. I also want to make a film that's a homage to 1980s movies and gets back to the sense of wonder that Hollywood has lost over the years. It will have those Spielberg-ian moments where you have the push-in on the wide-eyed kid and you feel like you're ten years old even if you're thirty-five."


— Tom DeSanto on why he produced the film[4]


Producer Don Murphy was planning a G.I. Joe film adaptation, but when the United States launched the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Hasbro suggested adapting the Transformers franchise instead.[5] Tom DeSanto joined Murphy because he was a fan of the series.[6] They met with comic book writer Simon Furman, and cited the Generation 1 cartoon and comics as their main influence.[5] They made the Creation Matrix their plot device, though Murphy had it renamed because of the film series The Matrix.[7] DeSanto chose to write the treatment from a human point-of-view to engage the audience,[8] while Murphy wanted it to have a realistic tone, reminiscent of a disaster film.[7] The treatment featured the Autobots Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Jazz, Prowl, Arcee, Ratchet, Wheeljack, and Bumblebee, and the Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp and Shockwave.[9]
Steven Spielberg, a fan of the comics and toys,[6] signed on as executive producer in 2004. John Rogers wrote the first draft, which pitted four Autobots against four Decepticons,[10] and featured the Ark spaceship.[11] Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, fans of the cartoon,[12] were hired to rewrite the script in February 2005.[13] Spielberg suggested that "a boy and his car" should be the focus.[14] This appealed to Orci and Kurtzman because it conveyed themes of adulthood and responsibility, "the things that a car represents in the United States".[15] The characters of Sam and Mikaela were the sole point-of-view given in Orci and Kurtzman's first draft.[16] The Transformers had no dialogue, as the producers feared talking robots would look ridiculous. The writers felt that even if it would look silly, not having the robots speak would betray the fanbase.[12] The first draft also had a battle scene in the Grand Canyon.[17] Spielberg read each of Orci and Kurtzman's drafts and gave notes for improvement.[14] The writers remained involved throughout production, adding additional dialogue for the robots during the sound mixing (although none of this was kept in the final film, which ran fifteen minutes shorter than the initial edit).[18] Furman's The Ultimate Guide, published by Dorling Kindersley, remained as a resource to the writers throughout production.[18] Prime Directive was used as a fake working title. This was also the name of Dreamwave Productions' first Transformers comic book.[19]
Michael Bay was asked to direct by Spielberg on July 30, 2005,[20] but he dismissed the film as a "stupid toy movie".[21] Nonetheless, he wanted to work with Spielberg, and gained a new respect for the mythology upon visiting Hasbro.[20] Bay considered the first draft "too kiddie", so he increased the military's role in the story.[20][22] The writers sought inspiration from G.I. Joe for the soldier characters, being careful not to mix the brands.[23] Because Orci and Kurtzman were concerned the film could feel like a military recruitment commercial, they chose to make the military believe nations like Iran were behind the Decepticon attack as well as making the Decepticons primarily military vehicles.[24] Bay based Lennox' struggle to get to the Pentagon phoneline while struggling with an unhelpful operator from a real account he was given by a soldier when working on another film.[20]
Orci and Kurtzman experimented with numerous robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers to form the final cast.[6] Bay acknowledged that most of the Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing the toys.[25] Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked.[26] Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script.[12] Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small.[23] An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.[16]
Design




The filmmakers incorporated valid physics into their designs, establishing the necessity for a robot's size to correspond to that of its disguise. The layout of Optimus Prime's robotic body within his truck mode is seen here.


The filmmakers created the size of each robot with the size of their vehicle mode in mind, supporting the Transformer's rationale for their choice of disguise on Earth.[27] The concept of traveling protoforms was developed by Roberto Orci when he wondered why "aliens who moonlight as vehicles need other vehicles to travel".[28] This reflected a desire to move to a more alien look, away from the "blocky" Generation&#160;1 Transformers.[29] Another major influence in the designs was samurai armor, returning full-circle to the Japanese origins of the toy line.[27] The robots also had to look alien, or else they would have resembled other cinematic robots made in the image of man.[30]
A product placement deal with General Motors supplied alternate forms for most of the Autobots, which saved $3 million for the production.[31] GM also provided nearly two hundred cars, destined for destruction in the climactic battle scene.[27] The military of the United States provided significant support, enhancing the film's realism: the film features F-22s, F-117s, and V-22 Ospreys, the first time these aircraft were used for a film; soldiers served as extras, and authentic uniforms were provided for the actors.[20] A-10 Thunderbolt IIs and Lockheed AC-130s also appear. Captain Christian Hodge joked that he had to explain to his superiors that the filmmakers wanted to portray most of their aircraft as evil Decepticons: however, he remarked "people love bad guys".[27]
Filming




Director Michael Bay filming at Holloman Air Force Base


To save money for the production, director Michael Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an eighty-three day shooting schedule,[20] maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him to work with a crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic.[20][22][31] A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006, and principal photography began on April 22 at Holloman Air Force Base,[3] which stood in for Qatar.[20] To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the pilots flying the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue as if it were an actual battle.[20][32]
The company also shot at the Hoover Dam and the Pentagon, the first time since the September 11, 2001, attacks that film crews had been allowed at these locations.[3] The external Hoover Dam scenes were shot before tourists arrived daily at 10:00&#160;a.m., with shooting moving inside for the remainder of the day.[32] Production in California was based at Hughes Aircraft at Playa Vista, where the hangar in which Megatron is imprisoned was built.[32] Six weekends were spent in Los Angeles, California shooting the climactic battle, with some elements being shot on the Universal Studios backlot and at Detroit's Michigan Central Station.[3][32] The crew was allowed to shoot at Griffith Observatory, which was still closed for renovations begun in 2002.[3] Filming wrapped on October 4, 2006.[22]

Spielberg encouraged Bay to restrict computer-generated imagery to the robots and background elements in the action sequences.[20] Stunts such as Bonecrusher smashing through a bus were done practically, while cameras were placed into the midst of car crashes and explosions to make it look more exciting.[32] Work on the animatics began in April 2005.[10] Bay indicated that three quarters of the film's effects were made by Industrial Light &amp; Magic, while Digital Domain made the rest,[20] including the Arctic discovery of Megatron; Frenzy's severed head; a vending machine mutated by the All Spark, and the Autobots' protoforms.[33] Many of the animators were big Transformers fans and were given free rein to experiment: a scene where Jazz attacks Brawl is a reference to a scene in The Transformers: The Movie where Kup jumps on Blitzwing.[27]


"I just didn't want to make the boxy characters. It's boring and it would look fake. By adding more doo-dads and stuff on the robots, more car parts, you can just make it more real."


— Michael Bay on the level of detail he wanted for the robots[34]


ILM created computer-generated transformations during six months in 2005, looking at every inch of the car models.[35] Initially the transformations were made to follow the laws of physics, but it did not look exciting enough and was changed to be more fluid.[36] Bay rejected a liquid metal surface for the characters' faces, instead going for a "Rubik's Cube" style of modeling.[20] He wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more interesting, realistic, dynamic and quick, rather than like lumbering beasts.[20][34] One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as long as possible, allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed.[37] Bay instructed the animators to observe footage of two martial artists and numerous martial arts films to make the fights look graceful.[20]
Due to the intricate designs of the Transformers, even the simplest motion of turning a wrist needs 17 visible parts;[3] each of Ironhide's guns are made of ten thousand parts.[34] Bumblebee uses a piece below his faceplate as an eyebrow, pieces in his cheeks swivel to resemble a smile, and all the characters' eyes are designed to dilate and brighten.[37] According to Bay, "The visual effects were so complex it took a staggering 38 hours for ILM to render just one frame of movement;"[3] that meant ILM had to increase their processing facilities.[38] Each rendered piece had to look like real metal, shiny or dull. This was difficult to model because the aged and scarred robots had to transform from clean cars. Close-up shots of the robots were sped up to look "cool", but in wide shots the animation was slowed down to convincingly illustrate a sense of weight. Photographs were taken of each set. These were used as a reference for the lighting environment, which was reproduced within a computer, so the robots would look like they were convincingly moving there. Bay, who has directed numerous car commercials, understood ray tracing was the key to making the robots look real; the CG models would look realistic based on how much of the environment was reflecting on their bodies.[27] Numerous simulations were programmed into the robots, so the animators could focus on animating the particular areas needed for a convincing performance.[38]
Music
See also: Transformers: The Album&#160;and Transformers: The Score
Composer Steve Jablonsky, who collaborated with Bay on The Island, scored music for the trailers before work began on the film itself. Recording took place in April 2007 at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California. The score, including the teaser music, uses six major themes across ninety minutes of music.[39] The Autobots have three themes, one named "Optimus" to represent the wisdom and compassion of the Autobot leader, and another played during their arrival on Earth. The Decepticons have a chanted theme which relies on electronics, unlike most of the score. The All Spark also has its own theme.[40] Hans Zimmer, Jablonsky's mentor, also helped to compose the score.[20]
Release
Transformers had its worldwide premiere at N Seoul Tower on June 11, 2007.[41] The film's June 27 premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival used a live digital satellite feed to project the film on to a screen.[42] A premiere took place at Rhode Island on June 28, which was a freely available event giving attendees the opportunity to buy tickets for $75 to benefit four charities: the Rhode Island Community Food Bank, the Autism Project of Rhode Island, Adoption Rhode Island, and Hasbro Children's Hospital.[43] The film was released on IMAX on September 21, 2007,[44] with additional footage that were not included in the general theatrical release.[45]
Marketing
Further information: Transformers: The Movie toy line,&#160;Transformers: Movie Prequel,&#160;Transformers: Movie Adaptation,&#160;Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday,&#160;and&#160;Transformers: The Game
Hasbro's toy line for the film was created over two months in late 2005/early 2006, in heavy collaboration with the filmmakers.[29] Protoform Optimus Prime and Starscream were released in the United States on May 1, 2007, and the first wave of figures was released on June 2.[29] The line featured characters not in the film, including Arcee.[27] A second wave, titled "All Spark Power", was set for release late 2007, which consisted of repaints and robotic versions of ordinary vehicles in the film.[46] The toys feature "Automorph Technology", where moving parts of the toy allow other parts to shift automatically.[47] Merchandise for the film earned Hasbro $480 million in 2007.[48]
Deals were made with 200 companies to promote the film in 70 countries.[49] Michael Bay directed tie-in commercials for General Motors, Panasonic, Burger King and PepsiCo,[50] while props — including the Camaro used for Bumblebee and the All Spark — were put up for charity sale on eBay.[51] A viral marketing alternate reality game was employed through the Sector 7 website, which presented the film and all previous Transformers toys and media as part of a cover-up operation called "Hungry Dragon," perpetrated by a "real life" Sector 7 to hide the existence of "real" Transformers. The site featured several videos presenting "evidence" of Transformers on Earth, including a cameo from the original Bumblebee.[52]
Reception


"From the king movie geek Harry Knowles of AintItCool.com to newspaper film critics and regular Joe (and Jane) comments, there is general raving about the mechanical heroes and general grumbling about the excessive screen time given to some of the human characters played by Shia LaBeouf, Anthony Anderson, Tyrese Gibson and Jon Voight. Optimus Prime, the leader of the good-guy Autobots, doesn't appear until midway through the film."


— USA Today[53]


Transformers fans were initially divided over the film due to the radical redesigns of many characters, although the casting of Peter Cullen was warmly received.[27] Transformers comic book writer Simon Furman and Beast Wars script consultant Benson Yee both warmly received it as spectacular fun, but Furman argued there were too many human storylines.[54] Yee felt that being the first in a series, the film had to establish much of the fictional universe and therefore did not have time to focus on the Decepticons.[55]
The film created a greater awareness of the franchise and drew in many new fans.[56] Transformers' box office success led to the active development of films based on Voltron and Robotech,[57] as well as a Knight Rider remake.[58] When filming the sequel, Bay was told by soldiers the film helped their children understand what their work was like, and that many had christened their Buffalos – the vehicle used for Bonecrusher – after various Transformer characters.[59]
After the film's 2009 sequel was titled Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Roberto Orci was asked if this film would be retitled, just as Star Wars was titled Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope when re-released. He doubted the possibility, but said if it was retitled, he would call it Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye.[60]
Reviews
The film received mixed reviews from film critics.[61] Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 57% of critics gave the film positive write-ups, based on 214 reviews,[62] with a positive 67% rating from selected "notable" critics.[63] At the website Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received a rating average of 61, based on 35 reviews.[61] IGN's Todd Gilchrist called it Michael Bay's best film, and "one of the few instances where it's OK to enjoy something for being smart and dumb at the same time, mostly because it's undeniably also a whole lot of fun".[64] The Advertiser's Sean Fewster found the visual effects so seamless that "you may come to believe the studio somehow engineered artificial intelligence".[65] The Denver Post's Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having "a believably rendered scale and intimacy",[66] and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised "that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon like myself became involved in the fate of these mega-machines".[67] Ain't It Cool News's Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story, and that "it has a real sense of wonder, one of the things that’s missing from so much of the big CGI lightshows released these days".[68] Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun, and said that "[Bay] manages to hold on to his audience's suspension of disbelief long enough for us to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes".[69]
Despite the praise for the visual effects, there was division over the human storylines. The Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honeycutt liked "how a teen plotline gets tied in to the end of the world",[70] while Empire's Ian Nathan praised Shia LaBeouf as "a smart, natural comedian, [who] levels the bluntness of this toy story with an ironic bluster".[71] Ain't It Cool News founder Harry Knowles felt Bay's style conflicted with Spielberg's, arguing the military story only served as a distraction from Sam.[72] James Berardinelli hated the film as he did not connect with the characters in-between the action, which he found tedious.[73] Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan found the humans "oddly lifeless, doing little besides marking time until those big toys fill the screen",[74] while ComingSoon.net's Joshua Stames felt the Transformers were "completely believable, right up to the moment they open their mouths to talk, when they revert to bad cartoon characters".[75] Daily Herald's Matt Arado was annoyed that "the Transformers [are] little more than supporting players", and felt the middle act was sluggish.[76] CNN's Tom Charity questioned the idea of a film based on a toy, and felt it would "buzz its youthful demographic [...] but leave the rest of us wondering if Hollywood could possibly aim lower".[77]
Box office
Worldwide, the film was the highest grossing non-sequel movie in 2007. It grossed $709.7 million, making it Michael Bay's second highest grossing film to date, with only the sequel surpassing this amount by more than $100 million.[2] The film was released in ten international markets on June 28, 2007, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and the Philippines. Transformers made $29.5 million in its first weekend, topping the box office in ten countries.[78] It grossed $5.2 million in Malaysia, becoming the most successful film in the country's history.[79] Transformers opened in China on July 11, and became the second highest-grossing foreign film in the country (behind Titanic), making $37.3 million.[80] Its opening there set a record for a foreign language film, making $3 million.[81] The film was officially released in the United Kingdom on July 27, making £8.7 million, and helped contribute to the biggest attendance record ever for that weekend. It was second at the UK box office, behind The Simpsons Movie.[82] In South Korea, Transformers recorded the largest audience for a foreign film in 2007, and recorded highest foreign revenue of the movie.[83]
In North America, the film had the highest per-screen and per-theater gross in 2007.[84] It was released on July 3, 2007, with 8 p.m. preview screenings on July 2. The U.S. previews earned $8.8 million,[85] and in its first day of general release it grossed $27.8 million, a record for Tuesday box office attendance. It broke Spider-Man 2's record for the biggest July 4 gross, making $29 million.[86] Transformers opened in over 4,050 theaters in North America,[2] grossed $70.5 million in its first weekend, amounting to a $155.4 million opening week, giving it the record for the biggest opening week for a non-sequel.[87] The opening's gross in the United States was 50% more than Paramount Pictures expected. One executive attributed it to word of mouth that explained to parents that "it [was] OK to take the kids". A CinemaScore poll indicated the film was most popular with children and parents, including older women, and attracted many African American and Latino viewers.[88]
Accolades
Before its release, Transformers was voted "Best Summer Movie You Haven't Seen Yet" at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards,[89] and at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards, it was voted "best movie". It was nominated for three Academy Awards, in the fields of Achievement in Sound Editing, Achievement in Sound Mixing, and Achievement in Visual Effects.[90] It received a 2008 Kids' Choice Award nomination for Favorite Movie.[91] The film received a Jury Merit Award for Best Special Effects in the 2007 Kuala Lumpur International Film Festival.[92] Visual effects supervisor Scott Farrar was honored at the Hollywood Film Festival and Hollywood Awards Gala Ceremony on October 22, 2007 for his work on the film.[93]
In 2008, the Visual Effects Society awarded Transformers four awards: for the best visual effects in an "effects driven" film and the "best single visual effects sequence" (the Optimus-Bonecrusher battle). The film's other two awards were for its miniatures and compositing.[94] Broadcast Music Incorporated awarded composer Steve Jablonsky for his score.[95] Entertainment Weekly named Bumblebee as their fourth favorite computer generated character,[96] while The Times listed Optimus Prime's depiction as the thirtieth best film robot, citing his coolness and dangerousness.[97]
Home media
Transformers was released in Region 1 territories on October 16, 2007 on DVD and the now defunct HD DVD format. The Wal-Mart edition of the DVD included a shortened animated version of the prequel comic book, titled Transformers Beginnings and featuring the voices of Mark Ryan, Peter Cullen and Kevin Dunn, as well as Frank Welker as Megatron.[98] The Target copy was packaged with a transforming Optimus Prime DVD case and a prequel comic book about the Decepticons.[98] The DVD sold 8.3 million copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling DVD of 2007 in North America, and it sold 190,000 copies on HD DVD, which was the biggest debut on the format.[99] The DVDs sold 13.74 million copies, making the film the most popular DVD title of 2007.[100]
It was released on Blu-ray on September 2, 2008.[101] In the first week, the two-disc edition of the Blu-ray was number one in sales compared to other films on the format. The Blu-ray version accounted for two-thirds of the film's DVD sales that first week, selling the third most in overall DVD sales.[102] On June 16, 2009, Paramount included a sticker on all new Transformers DVDs that contained a code to view exclusive content online from the first film and get a sneak peek at Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The content includes three exclusive clips from Revenge of the Fallen, behind-the-scenes footage from both films, and never-before-seen deleted scenes from the first film.[103] The DVD has sold 15.63 million copies, earning approximately $286,099,392 after more than two years.[104]

Posted on 02-11-2011 at 09:27 PM by NIBMRatchet under Video Games 

When we first revealed the Amazon listings of Transformers: Dark of the Moon Video Game, many were wondering &ldquo;Activision is the publisher, but who developed the game?&rdquo; The answer is now with us thanks to IGN. 
High Moon Studios (who developed Transformers: War For Cybertron) is the creative team behind the upcoming Transformers: Dark of the Moon Video Game. Game Director Sean Miller said that the gameplay is similar to WFC and will have a feature called &ldquo;Stealth Force&rdquo;. 
As mentioned on our Coverage of Hasbro New York Toy Fair 2011 Investor Event, this game will act as a prequel to the Movie Plot. 
Furthermore, fans are treated with three images from the game and the first trailer will debut on the Toy Fair itself.

Views: 7,736    Transformers Prime Episode 10 Title Revealed 
 

Posted on 02-11-2011 at 12:45 PM by Sol Fury under Transformers Prime  MSN have updated their program guide with the title of episode 10 of Transformers Prime. The tenth episode, slated to air on 03-11-2011, is titled "Deus Ex Machina". What could it mean? The literal meaning of the expression is "god from the machine", a technique used in classical Greco-Roman tragic performances for having a divinity appear and conveniently resolve things in favour of the protagonists. This is probably what is not going to happen, or this would be a very short series! Join in the speculation on this ambiguous title by clicking the discuss button below.  
You might also notice that the title of the ninth episode, Convoy, also has a very brief single sentence description summing up the main plot - Assisting Agent Fowler transporting an implosion device. 
Mild spoilers concealed for those who'd rather be kept in suspense! 
Don't forget that tomorrow sees the return of Transformers Prime with Masters and Students. Be sure to catch it at 6:30 pm EST!

Hey, how's everyone doing? Tonight we've got a bit of a retrospective update for our Transformers Toy galleries - It's a Hunt for the Decepticons themed update, brought to you by 2005 Photo Staff members SydneyY and thenatureboywoo! There's a bit of everything, from photos of the Fury of Bonecrusher set featuring Ironhide and Bonecrusher, to Tomahawk, Axor and Sunspot. It's all rounded off with a look at the Japanese version of Sidearm Sideswipe - which lacks the red flame details and swaps the clear red plastic for a smokey clear plastic for added movie accuracy. Check them all out by clicking on the links below:  TFW Bonecrusher (Fury of Bonecrusher) Gallery TFW Ironhide (Fury of Bonecrusher) Gallery TFW Autobot Alliance Sidearm Sideswipe (Takara-Tomy) Gallery TFW Hunt for the Decepticons Sunspot Gallery TFW Hunt for the Decepticons Tomahawk Gallery TFW Hunt for the Decepticons Axor Gallery

   Michael Bay Reveals Some Transformers: Dark Of The Moon Secrets - The End Is Nigh 
 

Posted on 02-10-2011 at 03:58 PM by NIBMRatchet under Transformers Movie (Just Movie) (All Transformers Movie News) 

This is a continuation of the previous Michael Bay interview, but requires some singled out attention. 
Michael Bay spoke more to MTV later. And he had some big secrets to reveal. If we consider this as "not misinformation"&hellip; then we now have the official confirmation of a certain character in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. 
Due to the spoiler-ish nature of the contents&hellip; you may read the details after the jump and the entire interview at MTV. 
Stay tuned with TFW2005 for all the latest Transformers 3 news as they happen.

Views: 9,268    MTV Interview - Michael Bay Worked Extra Hard To Get Transformers Dark Of The Moon Right 
 

Posted on 02-10-2011 at 02:15 PM by NIBMRatchet under Transformers Movie (Just Movie) (All Transformers Movie News) 

MTV had the privilege to talk with the heart and soul behind the Transformers Live Action Movie series; Mr. Michael Bay.  "I think it takes a while to get it right," Bay told MTV News about the creative process on the third "Transformers" film. "We did not want the third one to suck. We worked extra hard."    "We just have, I think, a better story," he said. "It's epic and it happens in a city, so it's more accessible because you recognize stuff; it's not in a desert. It's kind of like 'Black Hawk Down' with our small group of heroes in a city." 
The interview is small, that's true. But it's nice to know of the effort went into creating Transformers: Dark of the Moon.  
Releasing in theaters worldwide on 01/07/2011.

   MTV Peter Cullen Interview &ndash; TF: Prime, Optimus Prime&rsquo;s Evolution And Reveals A DOTM Spoiler 
 

Posted on 02-10-2011 at 12:48 PM by NIBMRatchet under Transformers Prime 

He is the iconic voice we all know and love. A brilliant man with a wonderful heart&hellip; Mr. Peter Cullen. 
MTV; who interviewed Roberto Orci, Jeff Kline and Frank Welker had a chance to interview Mr. Cullen himself. Voice of Optimus Prime of Transformers: Prime had wonderful things to share with us. 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going back to relying on the strengths of character, and expressing those traits. The writing is consistent with that of the original series, though in this new version &ndash; as in the movies &ndash; he has a lot more communication with earthlings, and so he tries to be a little more Earthlike. But 99% , I would say, is like the original Optimus.&rdquo; 
Read this wonderful interview where we get to learn more about Optimus Prime's evolution from G1 to Transformers: Prime at MTV. 
P.S : Almost forgot to issue a Spoiler Warning. Transformers: Dark of the Moon spoiler is included near the very end of the article.

   Crazy Devy Predaking Cannons 
 

Posted on 02-09-2011 at 02:47 PM by Sol Fury under 3rd Party Unlicensed  CrazyDevy has announced their latest add-on kit. Revisiting Predaking once more, this time they have a pair of oversized cannons for him, based on the larger ones seen in promotional art and Call of the Primitives. At 170mm long, they seem almost too big when standing straight up, although will probably look their most dramatic at a 45 degree angle. They are due in April, and are priced at $29.99.

   Alex Irvine Interview, Transformers: Exodus 2 Is Coming 
 

Posted on 02-09-2011 at 02:23 AM by NIBMRatchet under Video Games  Transformers: War For Cybertron 2 is coming next year says Hasbro. Meanwhile behind the scenes, Alex Irvine the author of Transformers: Exodus (prequel novel to Transformers: War For Cybertron) is currently working on Transformers: Exodus 2. Although the official title of the book is still a mystery, it is said that the title will contain the word &ldquo;Prime&rdquo;. 
Unicron.com had the privilege of interviewing Mr. Irvine and he had this to say&hellip; &ldquo;I don't want to say too much about it yet, but it does pick up where Exodus left off. And readers of this book will learn some stuff about the 13, but the book stays focused on OP and Megatron(mostly)I have an idea for a book about the 13. Maybe someday...&rdquo; 
You can read the rest of the interview at Unicron.

   Transformers: Dark Of The Moon Optimus Prime And Bumblebee Robo Power Cine-Masks 
 

Posted on 02-08-2011 at 12:19 PM by NIBMRatchet under Transformers Movie Toys &amp; Products (All Transformers Movie News) 

TFW2005 Boards Member SarahMobius told us that there was a preview of New York Toy Fair 2011 showing Transformers: Dark of the Moon Optimus Prime and Bumblebee 3D Robo Power Cine-Masks. 
Take a look at the video here : Today Show - Parenting. 
For those who read our Nuremberg Toy Fair 2011 article may have seen the info regarding two masks. 
Translated from German using Google Translator, the official description is as follows&hellip; "With the Transformers masks kids can become Bumblebee or Optimus Prime. The movable visor enables the vision modes &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fight&rdquo;. The masks have individually adjustable fit." 
SarahMobius&rsquo; finding clearly explained what this &ldquo;visor&rdquo; is all about. It's Transformers Movie Designed 3D Glasses to enjoy the movie in 3D (RealD).  
You will also receive a pair of Anaglyph 3D glasses (Red/Blue 3D) with a poster as a free give-away. 
Take your memory to 10-05-2010. We now know what "Robo Power" is about, completing the mystery of "Cyberverse", "Mechtech" and "Robo Power" (Legends Class Playsets, Movie 3 Gimmick and 3D Glasses respectively). 
Oh, in case you are wondering whether you can eat popcorn and drink soda in the theater wearing a Cine-Mask? Yes, you can&hellip; they are designed specifically that way. 
Take a moment to imagine your local theater.

   Dark of the Moon Deluxe Skids Pictorial Review 
 

Posted on 02-08-2011 at 10:35 AM by TM2 D-bot under Transformers Movie Toys &amp; Products (All Transformers Movie News) 

Our own Deceptigtar brings us a complete pictorial review for Dark of the Moon Deluxe Skids. Some things he had to say on the figure:  This is a new mold for Skids. He is actually about the same size in vehicle mold as his ROTF counterpart. There are some noticable difference on the car though as you can see. Also its kind of a reverse as he his mostly black with some green.

Posted on 02-08-2011 at 08:13 AM by Sol Fury under Transformers Movie Toys &amp; Products (All Transformers Movie News) 

Here's some tantalising news for you. Coming exclusively to Japan this July is something called "UA-01 Jetwing Optimus Prime". Priced at around 12,000 yen, it is a leader class figure. The solicitation, Red leader of our sponsors Kapow Toys reports, pictures Optimus Prime wearing his Jetfire armor, but at this time there is no picture of the actual toy. Could this be the spiritual successor of the canceled Unite for the Universe Jetpower Optimus Prime, only redone as a much larger toy? All we know for certain right now is the price, the fact it is Leader class, and the fact it is only coming out in Japan right now. There is also no picture available right now.

   Bonus Q &amp; A with Transformers Prime Creators - Answered! 
 

Posted on 02-07-2011 at 05:47 PM by Tony_Bacala under Transformers Prime 

Hasbro was kind enough to allow us to ask a question to the creators of the Transformers Prime series a bit ago, and today they sent back their response.  Our question was, thanks to input from you guys...  2 main characters have non-speaking communication methods. Bumblebee who communicates with Raf, and Soundwave who repeats things back. What was the creative process which lead to that; could these elements change in future episodes?

Transformers: Robots in Disguise





Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in her underwear
by Darren &#39;Starscream&#39; Jamieson on January 25, 2011

Following yesterday&#8217;s post where former Transformers actress Megan Fox appeared topless in an advert for Armani jeans it was perhaps only to be expected that the new Transformers actress, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who appears in this summer&#8217;s third Transformers movie &#8216;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#8217; would up the stakes.
Rosie was today seen on the Daily Mail&#8217;s website in a new campaign for Victoria&#8217;s Secret, dressed in a very provacative lingerie set. The model turned actress looked stunning in the underwear for the new campaign, pouting away in a bid to outdo Megan Fox&#8217;s campaign for Armani.
What do you think of Rosie? Are you looking forward to seeing what Transformers 3 director Michael Bay will have her do in the new film?
You can see more of her photos here.

Megan Fox Topless in new ad for Armani
by Darren &#39;Starscream&#39; Jamieson on January 24, 2011

She might not be appearing in Transformers 3, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but former TF siren Megan Fox is still a big hit with Transformers fans and guys everywhere. Megan has just appeared in a new advert for Armani where she bears an uncanny resemblence to Tomb Raider actress Angelina Jolie. In the Armani ad Megan Fox is topless, laying on her front in a pair of tight wight jeans. Some of her many tattoos are visible and she&#8217;s sporting the famous Jolie pout.
Despite her obvious similarity to Jolie, Fox has complained in the past at being compared to 35 year old vixen. In 2009 Megan Fox commented:
“It’s a lack of creativity on the media’s part. Because I have tattoos and dark hair and I was in an action movie? That’s as far as the similarities extend.”

MAJOR Auto Assembly 2011 &amp; 2012 Updates!
by Duh_Prez on January 13, 2011

Auto Assembly 2011 and 2012 Major News

Things have been quiet for the last few months from the Auto Assembly camp,  but with the start of a new year it&#8217;s time for us to make our mark with a  barrage of big announcements to take us into 2011 and beyond&#8230;
While many of you are now starting to make your initial plans about  attending one or more of the Transformers conventions that is taking place this  year (and we hope that Auto Assembly is one of them), we are proud to be able to  announce that we have been working overtime to be able to announce a massive  update to our guest line-up for Auto Assembly 2011&#8230;
But that&#8217;s not all. While many of you are still thinking about 2011, we are  pleased to announce that we have confirmed the first details for Auto Assembly  2012 and we believe that we are the first Transformers convention to do so! You  can find details of the date, venue and much more on our latest news update on  Youtube here &#8211; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASn1s5cE0ks
The video also has the full updates on Auto Assembly 2011 and this is one  video you do NOT want to miss!!
For those of you who have already booked for Auto Assembly 2011, we are  working through a backlog at the moment and emails that we are trying to deal  with which we hope to have sorted shortly. Our committee head has had to deal  with a number of unexpected personal issues over the last few months including  losing his job which has meant that Auto Assembly has had to take a back seat  for a short while but things are starting to return to normal for us now.
As part of this, we are still running behind with despatching the AA2010  Non-Attendee Packages. These should be shipping in a couple of weeks once we  have finalised the original sketches that will be part of these.
Anyway, for those of you who want to attend Auto Assembly 2011, tickets are  available now from our website. Ticket prices are £50 for adults and £38 for  children, students and senior citizens, with under 5s admitted free. One day  tickets are available for the Saturday or Sunday (although these will NOT get  you into the Friday or Saturday evening programmes) and these cost £30 for  adults, £21 for children, students or senior citizens and under 5&#8242;s as always  are free. Family tickets will be available shortly.
The convention is taking place over the weekend of 12th &#8211; 14th August 2011  at the Holiday Inn Birmingham City Centre, Birmingham, England. Tickets for Auto  Assembly 2012 will go on sale later this year.
For more details on  the convention, to see a full list of all the guests and activities taking place  over the weekend, or to book your tickets, visit the website at www.autoassembly.org.uk

We hope to see you all in August!

He also talks about some of his influences, and what films he enjoyed growing up. You can hear the interview here:

More than meets the&#8230;.side of a police car.
by sirlagerlot on October 12, 2010

With filming for Transformers 3 well underway in Washington D.C. you could be forgiven for thinking that this was all part of the movie.
Sadly, it wasn&#8217;t. While filming scenes, the Chevrolet Camaro portraying silent hero Bumblebee collided rather unceremoniously with a real-life police vehicle. The vehicle, according to D.C. Police is a part of the Explosives Ordnance Division, and was responding to a bomb threat. Although the roads were closed for filming, the emergency services will take the shortest route to an emergency &#8211; although as it turned out, the drivers shortcut was less than a perfect idea, as he obliviously drove into the path of the bright yellow Autobot
 Evidently, Bumblebees voice isn\&#039;t the only thing Ratchet needs to work on&#8230;

Michael Bay offers reward to find puppy killer
by Darren &#39;Starscream&#39; Jamieson on September 2, 2010

A recent video showing a Bosnian woman throwing a bag of puppies into a river has appalled people all over the world, including Transformers director Michael Bay. Bay was so disgusted by the callas actions of the woman that he offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of the woman.

The video, which we’re not about to show here, shows the woman wearing a red top and laughing as she tosses a bag full of three day old puppies into the river. You can also hear the puppies whimpering as they land in the water.
The actions of this woman have irked animal defence group PETA, and now Bay (currently working on Transformers 3) has offered the reward. Bay is a known dog lover himself and offered the reward via his blog.

FansProject Bruticus review and X-Fire 03 teaser
by Nemesis Scourge on August 21, 2010

daelite20 of the TFW2005 boards has posted a pictorial review of Fansproject&#8217;s Crossfire upgrade set for the Energon gestalt, Bruticus Maximus.
The instructions for this set offer us a tease of their next Crossfire release, which is leading many to guess that the remaining Energon gestalt, Constructicon Maximus (a.k.a. Devastator) will be receiving the same upgrade treatment.

I've literally heard people say &quot;I didn't like the movie... Too much fighting robots...&quot;
But﻿ then I'm like, nigga that's what the movie is all about... I mean that's something you could expect when you choose Transformers... I mean you have the animation series, the trailer, reviews, posters,... I mean goddamn motherfuckers... Not everything can be Titanic like!

Storyline
A youth chooses manhood. The week Sam Witwicky starts college, the Decepticons make trouble in Shanghai. A presidential envoy believes it&#x27;s because the Autobots are around; he wants them gone. He&#x27;s wrong: the Decepticons need access to Sam&#x27;s mind to see some glyphs imprinted there that will lead them to a fragile object that, when inserted in an alien machine hidden in Egypt for centuries, will give them the power to blow out the sun. Sam, his girlfriend Mikaela, and Sam&#x27;s parents are in danger. Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are Sam&#x27;s principal protectors. If one of them goes down, what becomes of Sam?

Trivia
According to the ILM animators, Devastator is made of 52,632 pieces (more than 10 times the number of individual parts in an ordinary car), 11,716,127 polygons, and 6,467 textures, and took up 32 gigabytes of computer space. If his components were laid end-to-end they would stretch 13.84 miles. All the gold ever mined in human history could build a little more than half of it.

What I expected

29 September 2009 | by lukalele (Australia)
    &ndash; See all my reviews


I&#x27;m amazed at some of the reviews on here. Seriously, what did people
expect outta this film? Shakespeare? The English Patient? You go to see
this for the ridiculous action, awesome special effects and just to
have a good time, which is what I had. Yeah, it did seem to overindulge
slightly and was slow in parts. Yeah, the humour&#x27;s cheesy, sometimes
painfully so. No surprise there though, let&#x27;s remember we&#x27;re watching a
film based on kids&#x27; toys, not a Bronte novel. It ain&#x27;t perfect, but if
you expected it to be, I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re feeling let down. For me, it
didn&#x27;t try to be anything it shouldn&#x27;t have and what it needed to do
right, it did.Mindless, thoroughly enjoyable fun, just like the first one.

Editorial Reviews

Amazon.com

  "I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?" deadpans Sam Witwicky, hero and human heart of Michael Bay's rollicking robot-smackdown fest, Transformers. Witwicky (the sweetly nerdy Shia LaBeouf, channeling a young John Cusack) is the perfect counterpoint to the nearly nonstop exhilarating action. The plot is simple: an alien civil war (the Autobots vs. the evil Decepticons) has spilled onto Earth, and young Sam is caught in the fray by his newly purchased souped-up Camaro. Which has a mind--and identity, as a noble-warrior robot named Bumblebee--of its own. The effects, especially the mind-blowing transformations of the robots into their earthly forms and back again, are stellar.    Fans of the earlier film and TV series will be thrilled at this cutting-edge incarnation, but this version  should please all fans of high-adrenaline action. Director Bay gleefully salts the movie with homages to pop-culture touchstones like Raiders of the Lost Ark, King Kong, and the early technothriller WarGames. The actors, though clearly all supporting those kickass robots, are uniformly on-target, including the dashing Josh Duhamel as a U.S. Army sergeant fighting an enemy he never anticipated; Jon Voight, as a tough yet sympathetic Secretary of Defense in over his head; and John Turturro, whose special agent manages to be confidently unctuous, even stripped to his undies. But the film belongs to Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and the dastardly Megatron--and the wicked stunts they collide in all over the globe. Long live Transformers! --A.T. Hurley
 

Product Description

  From director Michael Bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg comes a thrilling battle between the heroic Autobots&reg; and the evil Decepticons&reg;. When their epic struggle comes to Earth, all that stands between the Decepticons&reg; and ultimate power is a clue held by young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). Unaware that he is mankind&rsquo;s last chance for survival, Sam and Bumblebee, his robot disguised as a car, are in a heart-pounding race against an enemy unlike anything anyone has seen before. It&rsquo;s the incredible, breath-taking film spectacular that USA Today says &ldquo;will appeal to the kid in all of us.&rdquo;

4.0 out of 5 stars 
A blend of cringe inducing screenwriting, nostalgia and mind blowing action, July 3, 2007


By&nbsp;J. C. Amos (Seattle)  - See all my reviews
(REAL NAME)
&nbsp;&nbsp;





For a nerd that used to drool over this show as a kid, this movie hooks you from the very beginning.  From Optimus Prime's summary intro (with Peter Cullen still at the helm of our favorite alien semi) to the Decipticon attack on the military base, you have no doubts that this is Transformers.  Shia LaBeouf makes his entrance and proves the perfect part for this movie.  He's actually pretty funny and acts the part well.  As far as the rest of the humans in this cast, not as much can be said. After the awesome introduction, the first part of the movie deals mainly with Shia LaBeouf's Sam purchasing a Camaro that actually turns out to be the Autobot Bumblebee (in the cartoon, originally a VW Bug.  I think the yellow VW Bug in the car lot next to Bumblebee was a homage.)  Sam unknowingly uses his alien car to impress a girl.  Of course she actually is impressed when they find out it's an alien.  There are some pretty funny scenes in this part of the movie as well as some action scenes that are very well done. Soon comes the arrival of the other Autobots and they reveal to Sam their true purpose, which is to locate the Allspark -a powerful device capable of transforming a planet- before the Decepticons get a hold of it.  I thought at this point that the slow parts of the movie were over, but not quite.  From here we go into a few too many scenes dealing with side characters, from video game playing computer experts to goofy secret agents whose quirks border slapstick comedy.  Too many of these characters could be chalked up as comic relief, and most of what they attributed was not very funny.  There was a slightly funny but overly long scene where Sam was trying to hide the autobots while he searched through his house for a relic they needed.  And then arrived John Turtorro (playing the said goofy secret agent) whom I love, but who severely overstayed him welcome in this.  Other performances, namely John Voight's, were just plain campy and the cookie cutter dialogue was cringe inducing at times. Luckily, I forgot most of that by the time the movie got to its last act.  Once the Decepticons arrive in force the movie is a non stop ride of action and jaw dropping effects.  While someone who's not familiar with the characters and story might not care what the outcome is, I found myself with memories as a kid, watching the 1986 movie for the first time.  I forgot about the humans and their ho-hum sotrylines as my favorite characters and toys from my childhood crashed and shot and ripped each other apart.  I forgot that I was watching CG effects as the transformers look as real as the environment they're destroying.  The action scenes are larger than life and I'm amazed at how well the battles of the cartoons translated onto big screen.  The transformers themselves were all very well done, applying actual physics to their transformations and robot appearances.  They look real and modern but don't lose the heart of what the fanboys loved about them from back in the day.  And Hugo Weaving as Megatron was genius.  I missed hearing the original Starcream, but the original voice actor died many years ago, and the two or three lines Starcream had in this sounded suitable. Despite the great flaws in acting, dialogue and script, I left this movie with that rare itch to want to go straight back inside and watch it again.  From the previews, it looked like the movie was going to take a realistic perspective and show the warring alien machines from a human point of view.  But that's really not the case at all.  In every other Michael Bay movie, the corny dialogue and overdramatic characters ruin an otherwise good premise.  But Transformers is based on a cartoon, so why shouldn't the movie feel like one?  Here it works.  It's big, dumb nostalgic fun that the kid in me has been after for 20 years.

better than expected, December 8, 2007

This review is from: Transformers (Video On Demand)


Maybe it's not the best movie as far as dialogue goes, but for being an action movie about robots from outer space, it's good.  The transformations are good enough to not raise doubt about the mechanics of them (which is good for me as an aerospace engineer, because I tend to notice these things).  This is the kind of movie that makes large HD televisions and high-quality sound systems worth having.

Transformers does have more than meets the eye, July 3, 2007

(REAL NAME)
&nbsp;&nbsp;





Pretty much almost every male kid who grew up during the 80's were glued to their TV sets on weekday afternoons watching just one thing. They were watching one of the best cartoon shows on TV which also happened to be Hasbro Toys' most popular line of toys at that time. I am talking about Transformers. I know I was pretty much hooked on the show with its tale of good versus evil as the noble leader (who also happened to be a Mack truck) Optimus Prime led his Autobots against the evil robot that was Megatron and his Decepticons. It had lots of fighting, explosions and most of all, it had toys of every Transformer in the show for kids to re-enact such battles.  In 1986 the first Transformers movie (animated) came out and pretty much scarred every kid who was ever a fan of the show for life as their beloved characters actually died on-screen to make way for a new generation of Transformers. Let's just say that as much as I enjoyed the original movie I also hated it. It is now 2007 and Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg and ILM have concocted a live-action version of Transformers. To say that this movie has erased some of the bad taste left by the first animated film is quite an understatement. What we have in this live-action Transformers is nothing less than pure robot-versus-robot carnage and mayhem done so well that it more than makes up for the weak story and the uneven performances from the cast. The movie revolves around the search by both the Autobots and the Decepticons for the all-powerful AllSpark which would grant it's owner the power to rebuild the dying Cybertron (home world of the Transformers) or remake any planet into a new home. It's not too difficult to figure out what the Decepticons and their leader Megatron would do once they have it in their possession. As one of the Decepticons would have stencilled on its vehicle mode says: "To punish and enslave". The AllSpark is really just a MacGuffin which helps tie in the Transformers with the human aspect of the story and that's the time tested tale of a boy and his car. In this case, it's Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his newly acquired 1974 Camaro who also happens to be the Autobot Bumblebee unbeknownst to him. The first third of the film is where this boy and his car theme gets the most laugh as Sam tries to use his new car to get the attention of one  Mikaela (played by the ridiculously hot and appropriately named Megan Fox). The laughs come from Bumblebee playing just the right song over the radio to try and bring the two kids together. Usually Michael Bay's handle on comedy is a tad more cynical and ham-handed which tell me the first third of this film had Steven Spielberg's influence all over it. One could just substitute E.T. for Bumblebee and Elliott for Sam and it's not difficult to see. This first third also solidifies Shia LaBeouf as the foundation which keeps the movie from just becoming one long robot-on-robot action scene. This kid has some major talent and charisma which shows from the moment he steps on to the screen right up to the final scene with the sun setting in the background. It's no wonder Spielberg chose him to be in the next Indiana Jones movie. LaBeouf actually makes Sam Witwicky more than the awkward, geeky teen geek and instead makes it believable that he has a weird, charming chance to land the hot Mikaela. It's LaBeouf's performance as Saw which pretty much saves the very uneven performance by the rest of the cast. Even with LaBeouf's performance and the funny and cute boy meets car meets girl first reel, people really went to see this movie for one thing and one thing only and that's the battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons. The humans are there to ground the story in a semblance of reality. But once the two sides begin to arrive and find their Earth forms the movie shifts into nitrous-injected overdrive and doesn't let up until the very end. People cheered wildly once Optimus Prime appears for the first time with the rest of his crew (Ironhide, Jazz, Ratchet). The cheering went especially wild once optimus spoke for the first time and the original voice was heard (Peter Cullen did the voice for the original cartoon and was hired to do the same for the moive). That scene really brought myself and, most likely, every male in the audience of the same age back 20 years. The Decepticons make their entrance soon after with Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) being the final Transformer to hit the screen. The rest of the movie became one long action sequence after sequence with destruction being the norm. This is where Michael Bay's hand truly shows as his handle on the sturm und drang he's well-known for matches well with the premise of giant alien robots fighting each other with no thought for collateral damage to populace and property. Unlike, his previous films he actually holds himself back from using his usual tricks of using low-angled slo-mo scenes too much and the ultra quick editing style which makes his movies sometimes difficult to keep up with. Again, it might be Spielberg's influence in addition to Bay actually growing as a filmmaker to thank for this. The action scenes wouldn't be as great as it was if it wasn't for the work of ILM and its team of computer animators. The Autobots and Decepticons look so real that they join Gollum and Davey Jones as fully-realized CGI-characters who blend into the scene as if they're made of real flesh and blood. In the case of the Transformers made of steel, oil and rubber. Their battles from the Hoover Dam all the way to the nearby Mission City didn't look artificial. There's a sense of weight and depth to the battle. It atually looked like the city with it's small humans was actually being ripped apart by these giant robots. Industrial, Light and Magic truly deserve every award they'll get come awards time. In the past it was said that a live-action Transformers would come off as cheesy and fake, but technology and the expert use of it by ILM's team of artisans has made it a reality. Transformers really brings the word blockbuster and brings it like storm and thunder. There's no other way to say it than this was a movie which was a kickass rollercoaster ride with just enough human interaction to keep it from becoming cartoonish. It's not a perfect film as the weak script and uneven performances by most of the cast would show, but it's all balanced out by the work put in by Shia LaBeouf and the action scenes with the Transformers that this movie marks the highlight of the 2007 summer blockbuster season. Michael Bay has finally found the one film he looks to be tailor-made to do.

Transformers
Friday, April 13, 2007 Update by Josh &quot;Livestock&quot; Boruff

The Transformers were a staple of virtually every 80&#39;s childhood, combining the awesomeness of vehicles with mundane notions of robots. This week the Something Awful Forum Goons pay tribute to Transformers, by making dozens of new ones just as good as the originals.

		eightcell got this party rollin&#39; by combining his two favorite toy lines. He made about a million pictures this week.

Ecco the Dopefiend was as graceful as a lady when he made this.

eightcell finally has a chance to bring his loved of forced feminization to the forefront.

eightcell makes yet another image that blows.

This Dextromethod robot is adapted at fighting in tight quarters.

 &nbsp;Featured article&nbsp;



Jhiaxus is no ordinary Decepticon.  He and his faction left Cybertron eons ago and formed a Cybertronian empire of cyberformed planets.  He views the original Autobots and Decepticons as evolutionary throwbacks, simple animals, insults to his race's memory which must be wiped out.  But his ice-cold demeanor of control and amoral objectivity is merely a facade.  It is only a mask, a face he wears to forget the mad tyrant he once was.  He has been repressing this side of himself, burying it, for millennia.  Unfortunately, recent encounters with Autobots and Decepticons have been testing his resolve...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

SOME TIPS FOR PRINTING:
The site has ads in various places.&nbsp; When you click on the 
thumbnail image above it will open the full image in a separate window with 
advertising and navigation at the top.&nbsp; To print the coloring page
without printing the ad:
1)&nbsp; If you have JavaScript enabled you can click the
[Print] link in the top half of the page and it will 
automatically print the coloring page only and ignore the advertising and 
navigation at the top of the page.
if that doesn't work...
2)&nbsp; Click on the coloring page image in the bottom half of 
the screen to make that frame active.&nbsp; Then click the print button in your 
browser to print the active frame.
if that doesn't work...
3) Try clicking the link for the no ad version in the top 
half of the screen.&nbsp; This will open the coloring page in the same window 
but by itself at 
which point you can use the print feature of your browser.&nbsp;
If you're still stuck, check out our 
Print
Help&nbsp;section... once you sort out how to print one of our
coloring pages, the method will be the same for all the rest.
