Cartoons: I have uploaded an old-standing project of mine, namely completing DrSpengler's guide to the original G1 cartoon. I've finished and uploaded the guide and reviews for Season three and season four.November 29, 2010 - posted by Blackjack
Comics: Inflatable Dalek reviews issue 17 of the UK Transformers comic, while I wrap up the last two issues of Transformers: Drift and Transformers #12. Kudos to ziggy for proofreading.November 18, 2010 - posted by Blackjack
Comics: A big, big update on the site's comic section. The contemporary reviews for past comics that have been roosting in the forums for quite some time have finally been uploaded to the site proper. First up, Inflatable Dalek reviews All Hail Megatron #15 and #16, and issues #22 to #25 of the Titan Transformers comic. He has also reviewed all sixteen issues of the rebranded UK Transformers comic. Meanwhile, yours truly have reviewed Last Stand of the Wreckers (possibly the best-ever Transformers comic arc out there),  Spotlight Prowl, the first eleven issues of the new ongoing series, the Bumblebee miniseries, the Ironhide miniseries and the first two issues of Transformers Drift. Also, from IDW's movie tie-in comics, I've also done Tales of the Fallen and Nefarious. I've also reviewed some older material, including Balancing Act, a couple of IDW's collected comics, and reviewed the rest of the old 3H/Botcon comics.
 Also, if that's not enough, have some new toy reviews:
Toys: Transformers (2010):  Gen. Darkmount,  Gen. Megatron (WFC),  Gen. Red Alert,  Gen. Soundwave (WFC),  Revenge of the Fallen:  Scattorshot,  Skystalker,  Generation 1:  Snarl.
