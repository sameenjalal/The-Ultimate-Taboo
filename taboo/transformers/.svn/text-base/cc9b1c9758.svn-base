Overview
Featured Resources From Theory to Practice &#160;
OVERVIEW
Poetry can seem intimidating to many students, but the four-square graphic organizer strategy gives students a tool they can use to explore and analyze any poem. In this lesson, students will learn the definitions of alliteration, assonance, simile, and rhyme. Using these definitions and a graphic organizer, they will search through a variety of poems for examples of each poetic element. Finally, students will use what they&rsquo;ve learned to perform an in-depth reading of Mary Oliver&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;The Esquimos Have No Word For &lsquo;War&rsquo;&rdquo; and participate in a variety of extension activities. back to top

FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE
Brunn, M. (2002). The four-square strategy. The Reading Teacher, 55, 522&ndash;525.

The four-square strategy provides students with a visual representation of words and concepts in the form of a graphic or spatial organizer. The underlying function is to position several related terms, ideas, or concepts around one central element in a graphic or spatial organizer, then to help students understand the relationships that tie the various parts together.
Use of graphic or spatial organizers aids in systematic note taking by focusing tightly on the main idea and subordinate concepts.
Visual organization of new information helps students to remember, recall, and apply new knowledge to new situations.
