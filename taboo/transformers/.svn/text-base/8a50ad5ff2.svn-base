Storyline
A long time ago, far away on the planet of Cybertron, a war was being waged between the noble Autobots (led by the wise Optimus Prime) and the devious Decepticons (commanded by the dreaded Megatron) for control over the Allspark, a mystical talisman that would grant unlimited power to whoever possessed it. The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, but Megatron blasted off in search of it. He eventually tracked it to the planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sent him right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forced him into a paralyzed state. His body was later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, and before going into a comatose state Megatron used the last of his energy to engrave a map, showing the location of the Allspark, into the Captain&#x27;s glasses, and send a transmission to Cybertron. He is then carted away by the Captain&#x27;s ship. A century later...

Trivia
Devastator's alternate mode, a hybrid tank resembling the M1 Abrams and Leopard II, was a remodeled version of the "stealth tank" from 
xXx: State of the Union. Michael Bay had browsed through all the tanks in the United States Military to find the right tank to serve as Devastator's alternate mode, but finally settled on the stealth tank which he felt had the proper attitude for a Decepticon (it was mean, authoritarian and weapon-loaded). Additionally, the prop tank is much lighter than a real one, which was of benefit when most on-screen action was of it driving on paved roads.

Crazy Credits
Though hardly recognizable, the Paramount and DreamWorks jingles at the beginning are the original ones heavily altered digitally to be darker and robotic. They then merge with the title sequence music.

User Reviews

 &nbsp;

Great visual and sound effects, lots of humour and a lot of flaws.

30 June 2007 | by Christopher Reid (Australia)
    &ndash; See all my reviews


Transformers is a very mixed bag. There are great things about it and
there are some not-so-great things about it...The good:- The visual effects. Perhaps the best special effects I&#39;ve ever seen
in a movie. The transformations are amazing not to mention
super-awesome. The CGI fits in seamlessly with the live action and it&#39;s
easy to forget how logistically difficult a lot of it would have been
to film.- The sound design. The sound effects complement the action perfectly
making everything twice as exciting. Probably less acknowledged is the
alien atmosphere created by some of the score which heightens the
tension very effectively and probably without the majority of the
audience noticing.- Shia LeBeouf. Without him the movie wouldn&#39;t be nearly as engaging.
He has natural comic timing and is probably second to none in
expressing disbelief of the &quot;holy crap, there&#39;s a giant alien robot
transforming in front of me&quot; variety.- The humour. Transformers is funnier than most good comedies which I
was not expecting in the least. The transformers themselves are often
funnier than they are impressive.- The Decepticons. Man are they cool. The opening scene is particularly
kick-arse.The bad:- Megan Fox. If hot means &quot;can&#39;t act and doesn&#39;t weigh much&quot; then yes,
she&#39;s very hot. It&#39;s not a good sign if you want one of the main
characters to die or at least get out of the way and stop trying to
act. Her performance just seemed very shallow and probably wasn&#39;t
helped by her dialogue.- The script. Although the overall storyline is good, some of the
dialogue is terrible. Too much of the film is spent on mumbo jumbo
technical explanations the audience just doesn&#39;t care about. The less
serious parts of the script work very well though.- Michael Bay. Although some of the action scenes are very well put
together and the humorous parts are timed very well, Bay can&#39;t help but
ruin some of the scenes with unnecessarily flashy editing and over the
top drama accompanied by none-too-subtle dramatic music. It&#39;s not that
Michael Bay&#39;s style is too loud, it&#39;s that it&#39;s too clich&eacute;d.- The music. Nothing new here (other than the alien sounding parts).
Practically rips of Batman Begins and is otherwise forgettable. The
music should enhance the film by bringing out interesting themes or
emotions, not force feeding us the drama we can plainly see on the
screen in super slow motion.The ugly:- Megatron. He&#39;s ugly. And super cool.So, my verdict? The good outweighs the bad pretty comfortably. If you
took out the bad you might even have a classic on your hands. Instead
you get revolutionary action scenes and some great comedy with Michael
Bay&#39;s unique brand of mediocre directing sprinkled throughout.
