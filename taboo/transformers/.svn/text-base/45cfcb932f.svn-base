Storyline
A youth chooses manhood. The week Sam Witwicky starts college, the Decepticons make trouble in Shanghai. A presidential envoy believes it&#x27;s because the Autobots are around; he wants them gone. He&#x27;s wrong: the Decepticons need access to Sam&#x27;s mind to see some glyphs imprinted there that will lead them to a fragile object that, when inserted in an alien machine hidden in Egypt for centuries, will give them the power to blow out the sun. Sam, his girlfriend Mikaela, and Sam&#x27;s parents are in danger. Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are Sam&#x27;s principal protectors. If one of them goes down, what becomes of Sam?

Trivia
According to the ILM animators, Devastator is made of 52,632 pieces (more than 10 times the number of individual parts in an ordinary car), 11,716,127 polygons, and 6,467 textures, and took up 32 gigabytes of computer space. If his components were laid end-to-end they would stretch 13.84 miles. All the gold ever mined in human history could build a little more than half of it.

Goofs
Factual errors: 
In Shanghai, China, the characters on police vehicles and helicopters are in Traditional Chinese. They should be in Simplified Chinese.

Seriously...what happened?

29 June 2009 | by Lucian (Canada)
    &ndash; See all my reviews


i loved the first transformers, the acting/humour was superb and the
action was AMAZING. I was super anxious for transformers 2 and after
about an hr I was anxious to leave. I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore,
everything was stepped up to a bad degree. Too loud, too much action,
too much horrendous jokes and way too many robots! Half the time i was
trying to figure out whos who and there were so many plot holes that
bugged me, this all being in the first hr alone. There were three
characters that I truly DETESTED, the twin robots and that greasy
haired buffoon of roommate, it doesn&#x27;t get any more annoying than those
three. GAHHH and when all three of them were in the same scene I wanted
to kill myself.
