Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Bob Longino
      "Great special effects + Shia LaBeouf - flimsy story = lotsa fun." more...

B


Boston Globe, Wesley Morris
      "...a partly impressive, partly inane buck-banging toy of a movie." more...

B-


Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert
      "It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset." more...

B


E! Online, N.V. Cooper
      "...clunky, heartless and boring." more...
