How to Define Square Meter





By Terrence Strayer,
		eHow Contributor





A square meter is the standard international measurement for an area, expressed as m2. When the dimensions of a flat, two-dimensional space are described, the total area of the space is typically stated in meters squared.




Difficulty:
Moderately Easy

Instructions







1

Express a square meter as the area inside 4 straight lines of equal length that intersect at 90-degree angles to form an enclosed space.



2

A single square meter is the area equal in size to a square 1 meter long on each side.



3

Measure a space in square meters by multiplying the distance of one line by another. For example, a space extending 2 meters long by 2 meters wide would be defined as 4 square meters or 4 meters squared. A space 40 meters long by 15 meters wide would be defined as 600 square meters.



4

Define 1 square meter as square feet by converting the number of meters into feet, then squaring the result. Calculate this by multiplying the number of meters by 3.2808399 (the number of feet in 1 meter). If the area is 3 meters squared, then multiply 3 x 3.2808399 to get 9.843 feet. Multiply 9.843 x 9.843 to get 96.88 square feet, the same area as 3 square meters.
