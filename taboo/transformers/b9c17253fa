Posted on 02-11-2011 at 09:27 PM by NIBMRatchet under Video Games 

When we first revealed the Amazon listings of Transformers: Dark of the Moon Video Game, many were wondering &ldquo;Activision is the publisher, but who developed the game?&rdquo; The answer is now with us thanks to IGN. 
High Moon Studios (who developed Transformers: War For Cybertron) is the creative team behind the upcoming Transformers: Dark of the Moon Video Game. Game Director Sean Miller said that the gameplay is similar to WFC and will have a feature called &ldquo;Stealth Force&rdquo;. 
As mentioned on our Coverage of Hasbro New York Toy Fair 2011 Investor Event, this game will act as a prequel to the Movie Plot. 
Furthermore, fans are treated with three images from the game and the first trailer will debut on the Toy Fair itself.

Views: 7,599    Transformers Prime Episode 10 Title Revealed 
 

Posted on 02-11-2011 at 12:45 PM by Sol Fury under Transformers Prime  MSN have updated their program guide with the title of episode 10 of Transformers Prime. The tenth episode, slated to air on 03-11-2011, is titled "Deus Ex Machina". What could it mean? The literal meaning of the expression is "god from the machine", a technique used in classical Greco-Roman tragic performances for having a divinity appear and conveniently resolve things in favour of the protagonists. This is probably what is not going to happen, or this would be a very short series! Join in the speculation on this ambiguous title by clicking the discuss button below.  
You might also notice that the title of the ninth episode, Convoy, also has a very brief single sentence description summing up the main plot - Assisting Agent Fowler transporting an implosion device. 
Mild spoilers concealed for those who'd rather be kept in suspense! 
Don't forget that tomorrow sees the return of Transformers Prime with Masters and Students. Be sure to catch it at 6:30 pm EST!

   Michael Bay Reveals Some Transformers: Dark Of The Moon Secrets - The End Is Nigh 
 

Posted on 02-10-2011 at 03:58 PM by NIBMRatchet under Transformers Movie (Just Movie) (All Transformers Movie News) 

This is a continuation of the previous Michael Bay interview, but requires some singled out attention. 
Michael Bay spoke more to MTV later. And he had some big secrets to reveal. If we consider this as "not misinformation"&hellip; then we now have the official confirmation of a certain character in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. 
Due to the spoiler-ish nature of the contents&hellip; you may read the details after the jump and the entire interview at MTV.

Views: 9,255    MTV Interview - Michael Bay Worked Extra Hard To Get Transformers Dark Of The Moon Right 
 

Posted on 02-10-2011 at 02:15 PM by NIBMRatchet under Transformers Movie (Just Movie) (All Transformers Movie News) 

MTV had the privilege to talk with the heart and soul behind the Transformers Live Action Movie series; Mr. Michael Bay.  "I think it takes a while to get it right," Bay told MTV News about the creative process on the third "Transformers" film. "We did not want the third one to suck. We worked extra hard."    "We just have, I think, a better story," he said. "It's epic and it happens in a city, so it's more accessible because you recognize stuff; it's not in a desert. It's kind of like 'Black Hawk Down' with our small group of heroes in a city." 
The interview is small, that's true. But it's nice to know of the effort went into creating Transformers: Dark of the Moon.  
Releasing in theaters worldwide on 01/07/2011.

   MTV Peter Cullen Interview &ndash; TF: Prime, Optimus Prime&rsquo;s Evolution And Reveals A DOTM Spoiler 
 

Posted on 02-10-2011 at 12:48 PM by NIBMRatchet under Transformers Prime 

He is the iconic voice we all know and love. A brilliant man with a wonderful heart&hellip; Mr. Peter Cullen. 
MTV; who interviewed Roberto Orci, Jeff Kline and Frank Welker had a chance to interview Mr. Cullen himself. Voice of Optimus Prime of Transformers: Prime had wonderful things to share with us. 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going back to relying on the strengths of character, and expressing those traits. The writing is consistent with that of the original series, though in this new version &ndash; as in the movies &ndash; he has a lot more communication with earthlings, and so he tries to be a little more Earthlike. But 99% , I would say, is like the original Optimus.&rdquo; 
Read this wonderful interview where we get to learn more about Optimus Prime's evolution from G1 to Transformers: Prime at MTV. 
P.S : Almost forgot to issue a Spoiler Warning. Transformers: Dark of the Moon spoiler is included near the very end of the article.

Posted on 02-09-2011 at 02:23 AM by NIBMRatchet under Video Games  Transformers: War For Cybertron 2 is coming next year says Hasbro. Meanwhile behind the scenes, Alex Irvine the author of Transformers: Exodus (prequel novel to Transformers: War For Cybertron) is currently working on Transformers: Exodus 2. Although the official title of the book is still a mystery, it is said that the title will contain the word &ldquo;Prime&rdquo;. 
Unicron.com had the privilege of interviewing Mr. Irvine and he had this to say&hellip; &ldquo;I don't want to say too much about it yet, but it does pick up where Exodus left off. And readers of this book will learn some stuff about the 13, but the book stays focused on OP and Megatron(mostly)I have an idea for a book about the 13. Maybe someday...&rdquo;

   Transformers: Dark Of The Moon Optimus Prime And Bumblebee Robo Power Cine-Masks 
 

Posted on 02-08-2011 at 12:19 PM by NIBMRatchet under Transformers Movie Toys &amp; Products (All Transformers Movie News) 

TFW2005 Boards Member SarahMobius told us that there was a preview of New York Toy Fair 2011 showing Transformers: Dark of the Moon Optimus Prime and Bumblebee 3D Robo Power Cine-Masks. 
Take a look at the video here : Today Show - Parenting. 
For those who read our Nuremberg Toy Fair 2011 article may have seen the info regarding two masks. 
Translated from German using Google Translator, the official description is as follows&hellip; "With the Transformers masks kids can become Bumblebee or Optimus Prime. The movable visor enables the vision modes &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fight&rdquo;. The masks have individually adjustable fit." 
SarahMobius&rsquo; finding clearly explained what this &ldquo;visor&rdquo; is all about. It's Transformers Movie Designed 3D Glasses to enjoy the movie in 3D (RealD).  
You will also receive a pair of Anaglyph 3D glasses (Red/Blue 3D) with a poster as a free give-away. 
Take your memory to 10-05-2010. We now know what "Robo Power" is about, completing the mystery of "Cyberverse", "Mechtech" and "Robo Power" (Legends Class Playsets, Movie 3 Gimmick and 3D Glasses respectively). 
Oh, in case you are wondering whether you can eat popcorn and drink soda in the theater wearing a Cine-Mask? Yes, you can&hellip; they are designed specifically that way. 
Take a moment to imagine your local theater.

Posted on 02-08-2011 at 08:13 AM by Sol Fury under Transformers Movie Toys &amp; Products (All Transformers Movie News) 

Here's some tantalising news for you. Coming exclusively to Japan this July is something called "UA-01 Jetwing Optimus Prime". Priced at around 12,000 yen, it is a leader class figure. The solicitation, Red leader of our sponsors Kapow Toys reports, pictures Optimus Prime wearing his Jetfire armor, but at this time there is no picture of the actual toy. Could this be the spiritual successor of the canceled Unite for the Universe Jetpower Optimus Prime, only redone as a much larger toy? All we know for certain right now is the price, the fact it is Leader class, and the fact it is only coming out in Japan right now. There is also no picture available right now.

   Bonus Q &amp; A with Transformers Prime Creators - Answered! 
 

Posted on 02-07-2011 at 05:47 PM by Tony_Bacala under Transformers Prime 

Hasbro was kind enough to allow us to ask a question to the creators of the Transformers Prime series a bit ago, and today they sent back their response.  Our question was, thanks to input from you guys...  2 main characters have non-speaking communication methods. Bumblebee who communicates with Raf, and Soundwave who repeats things back. What was the creative process which lead to that; could these elements change in future episodes?
