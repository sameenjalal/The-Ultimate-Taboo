Word Origin & History
squarec.1300, "tool for measuring right angles," from O.Fr. esquire "a square, squareness," from V.L. *exquadra, from *exquadrare "to square," from L. ex- "out" + quadrare "make square," from quadrus "a square," from quattuor "four" (see quart). Meaning "rectangular shape or area" is first recorded before 1382; replaced O.E. feower-scyte. Sense of "open space in a town or park" is from 1687. The mathematical sense of "a number multiplied by itself" is first recorded 1557. The verb is first attested 1382; with ref. to accounts, from 1815.












squarec.1300, "containing four equal sides and right angles," from square (n.). Meaning "honest, fair," is first attested 1564; that of "straight, direct" is from 1804. Sense of "old-fashioned" is 1944, U.S. jazz slang, said to be from shape of a conductor's hand gestures in a regular four-beat rhythm. (Square-toes meant nearly the same thing in 1771, from a style of shoes then fallen from fashion.) Squaresville is attested from 1956. Square one "the beginning" is first recorded 1960, probably from board games; square dance first attested 1870.

square, closed plane figure bounded by four straight line segments of equal length and meeting at right angles. The points of intersection of the lines, or sides, are called vertices. The diagonals of a square are the two lines joining opposite vertices; they are of equal length and are the perpendicular bisectors of one another. The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of its sides, or P=4s, where s is the length of a side. The area enclosed by a square is A=s2. The square is one of the commonest geometric figures and has long had various symbolic meanings in religion and art.

In geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral. This means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90 degree angles, or right angles). A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted  ABCD.

[edit] Perimeter and area




The area of a square is the product of the length of its sides.


The perimeter of a square whose sides have length t is



and the area is



In classical times, the second power was described in terms of the area of a square, as in the above formula. This led to the use of the term square to mean raising to the second power.
[edit] Standard coordinates
The coordinates for the vertices of a square centered at the origin and with side length 2 are (±1,&#160;±1), while the interior of the same consists of all points (x0, x1) with −1&#160;&lt;&#160;xi&#160;&lt;&#160;1.




Construction of a square using a compass and straightedge.


[edit] Equations
The equation max(x2,y2) = 1 describes a square. This means "x2 or y2, whichever is larger, equals 1." The circumradius of this square is .
[edit] Properties
A square is both a rhombus (equal sides) and a rectangle (equal angles) and therefore has all the properties of both these shapes, namely:

The diagonals of a square bisect each other and meet at 90 degrees.
The diagonals of a square bisect its angles.
The diagonals of a square are perpendicular.
Opposite sides of a square are both parallel and equal.
All four angles of a square are equal. (Each is 360/4 = 90 degrees, so every angle of a square is a right angle.)
The diagonals of a square are equal.

[edit] Other facts

If the diagonals of a rhombus are equal, then that rhombus must be a square. The diagonals of a square are  (about 1.414) times the length of a side of the square. This value, known as Pythagoras’ constant, was the first number proven to be irrational.
A square can also be defined as a rectangle with all sides equal, or a rhombus with all angles equal, or a parallelogram with equal diagonals that bisect the angles.
If a figure is both a rectangle (right angles) and a rhombus (equal edge lengths), then it is a square.
If a circle is circumscribed around a square, the area of the circle is π / 2 (about 1.57) times the area of the square.
If a circle is inscribed in the square, the area of the circle is π / 4 (about 0.79) times the area of the square.
A square has a larger area than any other quadrilateral with the same perimeter ([1]).
A square tiling is one of three regular tilings of the plane (the others are the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon).
The square is in two families of polytopes in two dimensions: hypercube and the cross polytope. The Schläfli symbol for the square is&#160;{4}.
The square is a highly symmetric object (in Goldman geometry). There are four lines of reflectional symmetry and it has rotational symmetry of order 4 (through 90°, 180° and 270°). Its symmetry group is the dihedral group&#160;D4.

[edit] Non-Euclidean geometry
In non-euclidean geometry, squares are more generally polygons with 4 equal sides and equal angles.
In spherical geometry, a square is a polygon whose edges are great circle arcs of equal distance, which meet at equal angles. Unlike the square of plane geometry, the angles of such a square are larger than a right angle.
In hyperbolic geometry, squares with right angles do not exist. Rather, squares in hyperbolic geometry have angles of less than right angles. Larger squares have smaller angles.
Examples:



Six squares can tile the sphere with 3 squares around each vertex and 120 degree internal angles. This is called a spherical cube. The Schläfli symbol is&#160;{4,3}.

Squares can tile the Euclidean plane with 4 around each vertex, with each square having an internal angle of 90 degrees. The Schläfli symbol is {4,4}.

Squares can tile the hyperbolic plane with 5 around each vertex, with each square having 72 degree internal angles. The Schläfli symbol is&#160;{4,5}.


[edit] Graphs
The K4 complete graph is often drawn as a square with all 6 edges connected. This graph also represents an orthographic projection of the 4 vertices and 6 edges of the regular 3-simplex (tetrahedron).

How to Define Square Meter





By Terrence Strayer,
		eHow Contributor





A square meter is the standard international measurement for an area, expressed as m2. When the dimensions of a flat, two-dimensional space are described, the total area of the space is typically stated in meters squared.




Difficulty:
Moderately Easy

Instructions







1

Express a square meter as the area inside 4 straight lines of equal length that intersect at 90-degree angles to form an enclosed space.



2

A single square meter is the area equal in size to a square 1 meter long on each side.



3

Measure a space in square meters by multiplying the distance of one line by another. For example, a space extending 2 meters long by 2 meters wide would be defined as 4 square meters or 4 meters squared. A space 40 meters long by 15 meters wide would be defined as 600 square meters.



4

Define 1 square meter as square feet by converting the number of meters into feet, then squaring the result. Calculate this by multiplying the number of meters by 3.2808399 (the number of feet in 1 meter). If the area is 3 meters squared, then multiply 3 x 3.2808399 to get 9.843 feet. Multiply 9.843 x 9.843 to get 96.88 square feet, the same area as 3 square meters.

In mathematics, the root mean square (abbreviated RMS or rms), also known as the quadratic mean, is a statistical measure of the magnitude of a varying quantity. It is especially useful when variates are positive and negative, e.g., sinusoids. RMS is used in various fields, including electrical engineering; one of the more prominent uses of RMS is in the field of signal amplifiers.
It can be calculated for a series of discrete values or for a continuously varying function. The name comes from the fact that it is the square root of the mean of the squares of the values. It is a special case of the generalized mean with the exponent p&#160;=&#160;2.

[edit] Definition
The RMS value of a set of values (or a continuous-time waveform) is the square root of the arithmetic mean (average) of the squares of the original values (or the square of the function that defines the continuous waveform).
In the case of a set of n values , the RMS value is given by:



The corresponding formula for a continuous function (or waveform) f(t) defined over the interval  is



and the RMS for a function over all time is



The RMS over all time of a periodic function is equal to the RMS of one period of the function. The RMS value of a continuous function or signal can be approximated by taking the RMS of a series of equally spaced samples. Additionally, the RMS value of various waveforms can also be determined without calculus, as shown by Cartwright.[1]
In the case of the RMS statistic of a random process, the expected value is used instead of the mean.

Notes:
t is time
f is frequency
a is amplitude (peak value)
c&#160;% d is the remainder after floored division


[edit] Uses
The RMS value of a function is often used in physics and electrical engineering.
[edit] Average electrical power
Electrical engineers often need to know the power, P, dissipated by an electrical resistance, R. It is easy to do the calculation when there is a constant current, I, through the resistance. For a load of R ohms, power is defined simply as:



However, if the current is a time-varying function, I(t), this formula must be extended to reflect the fact that the current (and thus the instantaneous power) is varying over time. If the function is periodic (such as household AC power), it is nonetheless still meaningful to talk about the average power dissipated over time, which we calculate by taking the simple average of the power at each instant in the waveform or, equivalently, the squared current. That is,





 (where  denotes the mean of a function)



 (as R does not vary over time it can be factored out)



 (by definition of RMS)




So, the RMS value, IRMS, of the function I(t) is the constant signal that yields the same power dissipation as the time-averaged power dissipation of the current I(t).
We can also show by the same method that for a time-varying voltage, V(t), with RMS value VRMS,



This equation can be used for any periodic waveform, such as a sinusoidal or sawtooth waveform, allowing us to calculate the mean power delivered into a specified load.
By taking the square root of both these equations and multiplying them together, we get the equation



Both derivations depend on voltage and current being proportional (i.e., the load, R, is purely resistive). Reactive loads (i.e., loads capable of not just dissipating energy but also storing it) are discussed under the topic of AC power.
In the common case of alternating current when I(t) is a sinusoidal current, as is approximately true for mains power, the RMS value is easy to calculate from the continuous case equation above. If we define Ip to be the peak current, then:



where t is time and ω is the angular frequency (ω&#160;=&#160;2π/T, whereT is the period of the wave).
Since Ip is a positive constant:



Using a trigonometric identity to eliminate squaring of trig function:






but since the interval is a whole number of complete cycles (per definition of RMS), the sin terms will cancel, leaving:



A similar analysis leads to the analogous equation for sinusoidal voltage:



Where IP represents the peak current and VP represents the peak voltage. It bears repeating that these two solutions are for a sinusoidal wave only.
Because of their usefulness in carrying out power calculations, listed voltages for power outlets, e.g. 120 V (USA) or 230 V (Europe), are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not peak values. Peak values can be calculated from RMS values from the above formula, which implies Vp&#160;=&#160;VRMS&#160;×&#160;√2, assuming the source is a pure sine wave. Thus the peak value of the mains voltage in the USA is about 120&#160;×&#160;√2, or about 170 volts. The peak-to-peak voltage, being twice this, is about 340 volts. A similar calculation indicates that the peak-to-peak mains voltage in Europe is about 650 volts.
It is also possible to calculate the RMS power of a signal. By analogy with RMS voltage and RMS current, RMS power is the square root of the mean of the square of the power over some specified time period. This quantity, which would be expressed in units of watts (RMS), has no physical significance. However, the term "RMS power" is sometimes used in the audio industry as a synonym for "mean power" or "average power". For a discussion of audio power measurements and their shortcomings, see Audio power.
[edit] Amplifier power efficiency
The electrical efficiency of an electronic amplifier is the ratio of mean output power to mean input power. The efficiency of amplifiers is of interest when the energy used is significant, as in high-power amplifiers, or when the power-supply is taken from a battery, as in a transistor-radio.
Efficiency is normally measured under steady-state conditions with a sinusoidal current delivered to a resistive load. The power output is the product of the measured voltage and current (both RMS) delivered to the load. The input power is the power delivered by the DC supply, i.e. the supply voltage multiplied by the supply current. The efficiency is then the output power divided by the input power, and it is always a number less than 1, or, in percentages, less than 100. A good radio frequency power amplifier can achieve an efficiency of 60-80%.[2]
Other definitions of efficiency are possible for time-varying signals. As discussed, if the output is resistive, the mean output power can be found using the RMS values of output current and voltage signals. However, the mean value of the current should be used to calculate the input power. That is, the power delivered by the amplifier supplied by constant voltage VCC is



where IQ is the amplifier's operating current. Clearly, because VCC is constant, the time average of Pinput depends on the time average value of Iout and not its RMS value. That is,



[edit] Root mean square velocity
Main article: Root mean square speed
In physics, the root mean square velocity is defined as the square root of the average velocity-squared of the molecules in a gas. The RMS velocity of an ideal gas is calculated using the following equation:



where R represents the Ideal Gas Constant (in this case, 8.314&#160;J/(mol·K)), T is the temperature of the gas in kelvins, and M is the molar mass of the gas in kilograms. Note that the unit of mass is kilograms.
[edit] Root mean square error
Main article: Root mean square error
When two data sets---one set from theoretical prediction and the other from actual measurement of some physical variable, for instance---are compared, the RMS of the pairwise differences of the two data sets can serve as a measure how far on average the error is from 0.
The mean of the pairwise differences does not measure the variability of the difference, and the variability as indicated by the standard deviation is around the mean instead of 0. Therefore, the RMS of the differences is a meaningful measure of the error.
[edit] RMS in frequency domain
The RMS can be computed also in frequency domain. The Parseval's theorem is used. For sampled signal:
, where X(f) = FFT{x(t)}, n is number of x(t) samples.
In this case, the RMS computed in time domain is the same as in frequency domain:

[edit] Relationship to the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation
If  is the arithmetic mean and σx is the standard deviation of a population or a waveform then:[3]



From this it is clear that the RMS value is always greater than or equal to the average, in that the RMS includes the "error" / square deviation as well.
Physical scientists often use the term "root mean square" as a synonym for standard deviation when referring to the square root of the mean squared deviation of a signal from a given baseline or fit.[citation needed] This is useful for electrical engineers in calculating the "AC only" RMS of a signal. Standard deviation being the root mean square of a signal's variation about the mean, rather than about 0, the DC component is removed (i.e. RMS(signal) = Stdev(signal) if the mean signal is 0).

Macro DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO 

Syntax:

define-compiler-macro name lambda-list [[declaration* | documentation]] form* =&gt; name

Arguments and Values:

name---a function name. 
lambda-list---a macro lambda list. 
declaration---a declare expression; not evaluated. 
documentation---a string; not evaluated. 
form---a form. 
Description:


This is the normal mechanism for defining a compiler macro function. Its manner of definition is the same as for defmacro; the only differences are: 
*  The name can be a function name naming any function or macro. 
*  The expander function is installed as a compiler macro function for the name, rather than as a macro function. 
*  The &amp;whole argument is bound to the form argument that is passed to the compiler macro function. The remaining lambda-list parameters are specified as if this form contained the function name in the car and the actual arguments in the cdr, but if the car of the actual form is the symbol funcall, then the destructuring of the arguments is actually performed using its cddr instead. 
*  Documentation is attached as a documentation string to name (as kind compiler-macro) and to the compiler macro function.  
*  Unlike an ordinary macro, a compiler macro can decline to provide an expansion merely by returning a form that is the same as the original (which can be obtained by using &amp;whole).

Notes:

The consequences of writing a compiler macro definition for a function in the COMMON-LISP package are undefined; it is quite possible that in some implementations such an attempt would override an equivalent or equally important definition. In general, it is recommended that a programmer only write compiler macro definitions for functions he or she personally maintains--writing a compiler macro definition for a function maintained elsewhere is normally considered a violation of traditional rules of modularity and data abstraction.

3.8.9  define-compiler-macro
Macro




Syntax:
define-compiler-macro
name lambda-list [[{declaration}* $|$ documentation]] {form}*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; name

Arguments and Values:
name - a function name.


lambda-list - a macro lambda list.


declaration - a declare expression; not evaluated.


documentation - a string; not evaluated.


form - a form.


Description:

This is the normal mechanism for defining a compiler macro function.
Its manner of definition is the same as for defmacro; the only
differences are:



 The name can be a function name naming
 any function or macro.


 The expander function is installed as a compiler macro function
 for the name, rather than as a macro function.


 The &amp;whole argument is bound to the form argument that 
 is passed to the compiler macro function.  The remaining lambda-list 
 parameters are specified as if this form contained the function name in the
 car and the actual arguments in the cdr, but if the car 
 of the actual form is the symbol funcall, then the destructuring of 
 the arguments is actually performed using its cddr instead.



Documentation is attached as a documentation string 
    to name (as kind compiler-macro)
and to the compiler macro function.



 Unlike an ordinary macro, a compiler macro
 can decline to provide an expansion merely by returning a form that is
 the same as the original (which can be obtained by using
 &amp;whole).

Notes:

The consequences of writing a compiler macro definition for a function
in the common-lisp package are undefined; it is quite possible that in some
implementations such an attempt would override an equivalent or equally
important definition.  In general, it is recommended that a programmer only
write compiler macro definitions for functions he or she personally 
maintains--writing a compiler macro definition for a function maintained
elsewhere is normally considered a violation of traditional rules of modularity
and data abstraction.

square of a number being defined using #define

Hi,
I was just going through certain code's which are frequently asked in Interview's. I came up with certain doubts, if anyone can help me regarding this?
I am totally confused on this now, 
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;conio.h&gt;
#define square(x) x*x

main()
{
      int i,j;
      i=4/square(4);
      j=64/square(4);
      printf("\n %d",i);
      printf("\n %d",j);
      printf("\n %d",square(4));
      getch();
}

Output is :
 4
 64
 16

I am wondering, why did square(4) return 1 when i divided it? i mean how can i get the value 4 and 64 when i divide it but when used directly i get 16!!?

square is under-parenthesized: it expands textually, so
#define square(x) x*x
   ...
i=4/square(4);

means
i=4/4*4;

which groups as (4/4) * 4.  To fix, add parentheses:
#define square(x) ((x)*(x))

Still a very iffy #define as it evaluates x twice, so square(somefun()) calls the function twice and does not therefore necessarily compute a square but rather the product of the two successive calls, of course;-).

@Alex yea.. got it.. was getting mad over it..  &ndash;&nbsp;Nagaraj Tantri Sep 15 '10 at 15:47



+1 for square(somefun()). The usual observation in that case is about side effect done twice, but if you imagine square(rand()) you are getting the product of two random numbers, not the square of a single random number. &ndash;&nbsp;RBerteig Sep 15 '10 at 18:42

When you write i=4/square(4), the preprocessor expands that to i = 4 / 4 * 4.
Because C groups operations from left to right, the compiler interprets that as i = (4 / 4) * 4, which is equivalent to 1 * 4.
You need to add parentheses, like this:
#define square(x) ((x)*(x))

This way, i=4/square(4) turns into i = 4 / ((4) * (4)).
You need the additional parentheses around x in case you write square(1 + 1), which would otherwise turn into 1 + 1 * 1 + 1, which is evaluated as 1 + (1 * 1) + 1, or 3.

i=4/square(4);

expands to 
i=4/4*4;

i=(4/4)*4;

That's because the compiler replaces it with:
i=4/4*4; 
j=64/4*4;

i = (4/4)*4 = 1*4 = 4.
j = (64/4)*4 = 16*4 = 64.

Operator precedence is hurting you.
The macro is expanded by the pre-processor such that 
  i=4/4*4;
  j=64/4*4;

which is equivalent to:
  i=(4/4)*4;
  j=(64/4)*4;

Manually expand the macro in the code, and it will be clear. That is, replace all the square(x) with exactly x*x, in particular don't add any parentheses.

define is just a text macro
main()
{
      int i,j;
      i=4/ 4 * 4;  // 1 * 4
      j=64/4 * 4; // 16 * 4
      printf("\n %d",i);
      printf("\n %d",j);
      printf("\n %d",square(4));

It's a macro! So it returns exactly what it substitutes.
i = 4/4*4;   Which is 4...
j = 64/4*4;   Which is 16...

Try this for your macro:
#define square(x) ((x)*(x))

Because of operator precedence in the expression after the preprocessor - you'll need to write 
#define square(x) (x*x)

As the other answers say, you're getting burned by operator precedence.  Change your square macro to this:
#define square(x) (x*x)

and it'll work the way you expect.

Overview
Featured Resources From Theory to Practice &#160;
OVERVIEW
Poetry can seem intimidating to many students, but the four-square graphic organizer strategy gives students a tool they can use to explore and analyze any poem. In this lesson, students will learn the definitions of alliteration, assonance, simile, and rhyme. Using these definitions and a graphic organizer, they will search through a variety of poems for examples of each poetic element. Finally, students will use what they&rsquo;ve learned to perform an in-depth reading of Mary Oliver&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;The Esquimos Have No Word For &lsquo;War&rsquo;&rdquo; and participate in a variety of extension activities. back to top

&#160;
FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE
Brunn, M. (2002). The four-square strategy. The Reading Teacher, 55, 522&ndash;525.

The four-square strategy provides students with a visual representation of words and concepts in the form of a graphic or spatial organizer. The underlying function is to position several related terms, ideas, or concepts around one central element in a graphic or spatial organizer, then to help students understand the relationships that tie the various parts together.
Use of graphic or spatial organizers aids in systematic note taking by focusing tightly on the main idea and subordinate concepts.
Visual organization of new information helps students to remember, recall, and apply new knowledge to new situations.

In mathematics, a square root of a number x is a number r such that r2 = x, or, in other words, a number r whose square (the result of multiplying the number by itself, or r&#160;×&#160;r) is x.[1] For example, 4 is a square root of 16 because 4×4=16.
Every non-negative real number x has a unique non-negative square root, called the principal square root, denoted by a radical sign as . For positive x, the principal square root can also be written in exponent notation, as x1/2. For example, the principal square root of 9 is 3, denoted , because 32 = 3 × 3 = 9 and 3 is non-negative. Although the principal square root of a positive number is only one of its two square roots, the designation "the square root" is often used to refer to the principal square root.
Every positive number x has two square roots. One of them is , which is positive, and the other , which is negative. Together, these two roots are denoted  (see ± shorthand). Square roots of negative numbers can be discussed within the framework of complex numbers. More generally, square roots can be considered in any context in which a notion of "squaring" of some mathematical objects is defined (including algebras of matrices, endomorphism rings, etc.)
Square roots of integers that are not perfect squares are always irrational numbers: numbers not expressible as a ratio of two integers (that is to say they cannot be written exactly as m/n, where n and m are integers). This is the theorem Euclid X, 9 almost certainly due to Theaetetus dating back to circa 380 BC.[2] The particular case  is assumed to date back earlier to the Pythagoreans and is traditionally attributed to Hippasus. It is exactly the length of the diagonal of a square with side length 1.
The term whose root is being considered is known as the radicand. For example, in the expression , ab + 2 is the radicand. The radicand is the number or expression underneath the radical sign.

 Properties




The graph of the function , made up of half a parabola with a vertical directrix.


The principal square root function  (usually just referred to as the "square root function") is a function that maps the set of non-negative real numbers onto itself. In geometrical terms, the square root function maps the area of a square to its side length.
The square root of x is rational if and only if x is a rational number that can be represented as a ratio of two perfect squares. (See square root of 2 for proofs that this is an irrational number, and quadratic irrational for a proof for all non-square natural numbers.) The square root function maps rational numbers into algebraic numbers (a superset of the rational numbers).

and



The square root function is continuous for all non-negative x and differentiable for all positive x. If f denotes the square-root function, its derivative is given by:



The Taylor series of √1 + x about x = 0 converges for |x| ≤ 1 and is given by



which is a special case of a Binomial series.
 Computation
Main article: Methods of computing square roots
Most pocket calculators have a square root key. Computer spreadsheets and other software are also frequently used to calculate square roots. Pocket calculators typically implement good routines to compute the exponential function and the natural logarithm or logarithm, and then compute the square root of a positive real number x using the identity

 or 

The same identity is exploited when computing square roots with logarithm tables or slide rules.
The most common iterative method of square root calculation by hand is known as the "Babylonian method" or "Heron's method" after the first century Greek philosopher Heron of Alexandria who first described it.[3] The technique is an application of the Newton-Raphson iterative solution method to the function , using the fact that its slope at any point is . [4] It involves a simple algorithm, which results in a number closer to the actual square root each time it is repeated. To find x, the square root of a non-negative real number a:

Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the square root of a, the fewer iterations will be needed to achieve the desired precision).
Replace x by the average between x and a/x, that is: , representing the Newton-Raphson scheme  resulting in ,
(It is sufficient to take an approximate value of the average to ensure convergence)

Repeat step 2 until x and a/x are as close as desired.

If a is positive, the convergence is "quadratic," which means that in approaching the limit, the number of correct digits roughly doubles in each next iteration. If a = 0, the convergence is only linear.
Using the identity



the computation of the square root of a positive number can be reduced to that of a number in the range [1,&#160;4). This simplifies finding a start value for the iterative method that is close to the square root, for which a polynomial or piecewise-linear approximation can be used.
The time complexity for computing a square root with n digits of precision is equivalent to that of multiplying two n-digit numbers.
 Square roots of negative and complex numbers




Complex square root






Second leaf of the complex square root






Using the Riemann surface of the square root, one can see how the two leaves fit together


The square of any positive or negative number is positive, and the square of 0 is 0. Therefore, no negative number can have a real square root. However, it is possible to work with a more inclusive set of numbers, called the complex numbers, that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number. This is done by introducing a new number, denoted by i (sometimes j, especially in the context of electricity where "i" traditionally represents electric current) and called the imaginary unit, which is defined such that i2&#160;=&#160;−1. Using this notation, we can think of i as the square root of −1, but notice that we also have (−i)2&#160;=&#160;i2&#160;=&#160;−1 and so −i is also a square root of −1. By convention, the principal square root of −1 is i, or more generally, if x is any positive number, then the principal square root of −x is



The right side (as well as its negative) is indeed a square root of −x, since



For every non-zero complex number z there exist precisely two numbers w such that w2&#160;=&#160;z: the principal square root of z (defined below), and its negative.
 Square root of an imaginary number




The square roots of i in the complex plane


The square root of i is given by



This result can be obtained algebraically by finding a and b such that



or equivalently



This gives the two simultaneous equations



with solutions



The choice of the principal root then gives



The result can also be obtained by using de Moivre's formula and setting



which produces



 Principal square root of a complex number
To find a definition for the square root that allows us to consistently choose a single value, called the principal value, we start by observing that any complex number x + iy can be viewed as a point in the plane, (x, y), expressed using Cartesian coordinates. The same point may be reinterpreted using polar coordinates as the pair (r, φ), where r ≥ 0 is the distance of the point from the origin, and φ is the angle that the line from the origin to the point makes with the positive real (x) axis. In complex analysis, this value is conventionally written r eiφ. If



then we define the principal square root of z as follows:



The principal square root function is thus defined using the nonpositive real axis as a branch cut. The principal square root function is holomorphic everywhere except on the set of non-positive real numbers (on strictly negative reals it isn't even continuous). The above Taylor series for √1 + x remains valid for complex numbers x with |x|&#160;&lt;&#160;1.
The above can also be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions:



 Algebraic formula
When the number is expressed using Cartesian coordinates the following formula can be used for the principal square root:[5][6]



where the sign of the imaginary part of the root is taken to be same as the sign of the imaginary part of the original number, and



is the absolute value or modulus of the original number. The real part of the principal value is always non-negative.
The other square root is simply –1 times the principal square root; in other words, the two square roots of a number sum to 0.
 Notes
Because of the discontinuous nature of the square root function in the complex plane, the law √zw = √z√w is in general not true. (Equivalently, the problem occurs because of the freedom in the choice of branch. The chosen branch may or may not yield the equality; in fact, the choice of branch for the square root need not contain the value of √z√w at all, leading to the equality's failure. A similar problem appears with the complex logarithm and the relation log z + log w = log(zw).) Wrongly assuming this law underlies several faulty "proofs", for instance the following one showing that −1&#160;=&#160;1:



The third equality cannot be justified (see invalid proof). It can be made to hold by changing the meaning of √ so that this no longer represents the principal square root (see above) but selects a branch for the square root that contains (√−1)·(√−1). The left hand side becomes either



if the branch includes +i or



if the branch includes −i, while the right hand side becomes



where the last equality, √1 = −1, is a consequence of the choice of branch in the redefinition of √.
 Square roots of matrices and operators
Main article: square root of a matrix
If A is a positive-definite matrix or operator, then there exists precisely one positive definite matrix or operator B with B2 = A; we then define A1/2 = √A = B. In general matrices may have multiple square roots or even an infinitude of them. For example the 2×2 identity matrix has an infinity of square roots.[7]
 Principal square roots of the positive integers
 As decimal expansions
The square roots of the perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.) are integers. In all other cases, the square roots are irrational numbers, and therefore their decimal representations are non-repeating decimals.

Note that if the radicand is not square-free one can simplify, for example ; ;  and .
 As expansions in other numeral systems
The square roots of the perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.) are integers. In all other cases, the square roots are irrational numbers, and therefore their representations in any standard positional notation system are non-repeating.
The square roots of small integers are used in both the SHA-1 and SHA-2 hash function designs to provide nothing up my sleeve numbers.
 As periodic continued fractions
One of the most intriguing results from the study of irrational numbers as continued fractions was obtained by Joseph Louis Lagrange circa 1780. Lagrange found that the representation of the square root of any non-square positive integer as a continued fraction is periodic. That is, a certain pattern of partial denominators repeats indefinitely in the continued fraction. In a sense these square roots are the very simplest irrational numbers, because they can be represented with a simple repeating pattern of integers.






[1; 2, 2, ...]




[1; 1, 2, 1, 2, ...]




[2]




[2; 4, 4, ...]




[2; 2, 4, 2, 4, ...]




[2; 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, ...]




[2; 1, 4, 1, 4, ...]




[3]




[3; 6, 6, ...]




[3; 3, 6, 3, 6, ...]

[3; 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, ...]

[4; 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8, ...]




[4; 2, 8, 2, 8, ...]




The square bracket notation used above is a sort of mathematical shorthand to conserve space. Written in more traditional notation the simple continued fraction for the square root of 11 – [3; 3, 6, 3, 6, ...] – looks like this:



where the two-digit pattern {3, 6} repeats over and over and over again in the partial denominators. Since 11 = 32+2, the above is also identical to the following generalized continued fractions:



 Geometric construction of the square root
A square root can be constructed with a compass and straightedge. In his Elements, Euclid (fl. 300 BC) gave the construction of the geometric mean of two quantities in two different places: Proposition II.14 and Proposition VI.13. Since the geometric mean of a and b is , one can construct  simply by taking b = 1.
The construction is also given by Descartes in his La Géométrie, see figure 2 on page 2. However, Descartes made no claim to originality and his audience would have been quite familiar with Euclid.
Another method of geometric construction uses right triangles and induction:  can, of course, be constructed, and once  has been constructed, the right triangle with 1 and  for its legs has a hypotenuse of . The Spiral of Theodorus is constructed using successive square roots in this manner.
 History
The Yale Babylonian Collection YBC 7289 clay tablet was created between 1800 BC and 1600 BC, showing  and  as 1;24,51,10 and 42;25,35 base 60 numbers on a square crossed by two diagonals.[8]
The Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is a copy from 1650 BC of an even earlier work and shows us how the Egyptians extracted square roots.[9]
In Ancient India, the knowledge of theoretical and applied aspects of square and square root was at least as old as the Sulba Sutras, dated around 800-500 BC (possibly much earlier)[citation needed]. A method for finding very good approximations to the square roots of 2 and 3 are given in the Baudhayana Sulba Sutra.[10] Aryabhata in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.4), has given a method for finding the square root of numbers having many digits.
In the Chinese mathematical work Writings on Reckoning, written between 202 BC and 186 BC during the early Han Dynasty, the square root is approximated by using an "excess and deficiency" method, which says to "...combine the excess and deficiency as the divisor; (taking) the deficiency numerator multiplied by the excess denominator and the excess numerator times the deficiency denominator, combine them as the dividend."[11]
According to historian of mathematics D.E. Smith, Aryabhata's method for finding the square root was first introduced in Europe by Cataneo in 1546.[12]
The symbol √ for the square root was first used in print in 1525 in Christoph Rudolff's Coss, which was also the first to use the then-new signs '+' and '-'.[13]

Buy Sell A Home

How is residential "livable space" legally defined and measured?









                	The definition of livable square feet is one that will vary by location, just as, for example, the definition of a bedroom varies by location. (For example, some places require there to be a closet to classify a room as a bedroom.) Some good ways to find out how livable square feet are measured in your location would be to ask realtors, real estate appraisers, and your municipality&rsquo;s building department. 
More to the point, to a large extent, there is no way to &ldquo;enforce&rdquo; a definition against prospective buyers who disagree. The simple fact of the matter is, no one is forced to buy a home they do not want. So whether your home, for example, is listed at being 1,500 square feet or 1,679 square feet or even 2,112 square feet&mdash;or any other measurement&mdash;if your buyers don&rsquo;t feel the home is big enough for them, they are not going to purchase it.
The only common situations in which the exact size of a home may be of legal import would be:
1) For tax appraisal purposes
2) For qualifying for a certain mortgage or home equity loan  
3) If a buyer has already bought, or at least has signed a contract on a home, and now claims that fraud was committed because the home is not as large as advertised.
In that last case in particular, the exact definition of livable square feet could clearly impact liability. As noted above, there will be some definition used in your area&mdash;apply that definition for determining the square footage. The livable square footage will be whatever it is under that definition.
On a forward-looking basis, the best way to avoid potential problems is to simply disclose all information in a transparent way. For example, say you have a home with a finished basement and a finished attic, and are concerned that the basement and attic may not be considered &ldquo;livable square feet.&rdquo; Unless you&rsquo;re certain of your definition, list the home as (e.g.) &ldquo;2,100 sq. foot home with 800 sq. foot finished basement and 400 sq. foot finished attic providing additional space&rdquo; rather than as 3,300 sq. foot home&mdash;nobody can object to a truthful definition.

Word Square


A word square is a special type of acrostic. It consists of a set of words written out in a square grid, such that the same words can be read both horizontally and vertically. The number of words, which is equal to the number of letters in each word, is known as the "order" of the square. For example, this is an order 5 square:


H E A R T  E M B E R 
 A B U S E  R E S I N  

A popular puzzle dating well into ancient times, the word square is sometimes compared to the magic square, though apart from the fact that both use square grids there is no real connection between the two.
