Lookup &#38; Pet Page Coding Update&#33;
on Tuesday, February 8th 2011 @ 10:43 pm EST by hrtbrk
After last weeks coding fiasco, TNT stated in the Editorial that textareas and other features would be returning. Of course, this left designers wondering when that would happen. Today is the day&#33; 


QuoteGood news for coders&#33; The maximum character length for User Lookups is now 5,000 characters (not 4,000 as they were previously)&#33; 

Also, &lt;textarea&gt; tags as well as the &#39;display&#39; and &#39;margin&#39; CSS attributes have been added back onto Pet Pages and User Lookups&#33; Hooray&#33;
