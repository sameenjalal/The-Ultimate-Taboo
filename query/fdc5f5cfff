Storyline
The Empire of Izmer has long been a divided land. The Mages - an elite group of magic users - rule whilst the lowly commoners are powerless. Izmer&#x27;s young Empress, Savina, wants equality and prosperity for all, but the evil Mage Profion is plotting to depose her, and establish his own rule. The Empress possesses a scepter which controls Izmer&#x27;s Golden Dragons. To challenge her rule, Profion must have the scepter, and tricks the Council of Mages into believing Savina is unfit to hold it. Knowing that Profion will bring death and destruction to Izmer, Savina, must find the legendary Rod of Savrille, a mythical rod that has the power to control Red Dragons, a species even mightier than the Gold. Enter two thieves, Ridley and Snails, who unwittingly become instrumental in Savina&#x27;s search for the Rod. Joined by a feisty Dwarf named Elwood, and helped by the Empress&#x27;s expert tracker, the Elf Norda...

disgraceful

26 May 2001 | by Duncan Wilson (Snooch) (London, England)
    &ndash; See all my reviews



I can only hope and pray that all the actors and actresses who appear in
this film realise their mistake and get alternative means of income, they
should be ashamed of the performances they put in. Marlon Wayans does an
irritatingly poor and ill-advised Chris Rock impression all the way through
the film that just makes you squirm and cringe. The other performances
ranged from the badly cast, Thora Birch whose other work has been superb, as
the princess to the ridiculous, represented by the performance of Justin
Whalin. 
The total lack of any character development (which for me was needed as
the characters are different from the cartoon I used to love) and the
shallow acting all meant that I couldn't have cared less what happened to
the characters, let alone cling on to the paper thin plot. With all this
though, I sat through the entire movie,waiting for the end and feeling sure
that Rocky and Bullwinkle Must be better than this pile of toss, and that
dude, is saying a LOT...
