U.S. National Team when she debuted for the USA in 1987 at the age of 15
Years, 140 days. Since then, she has compiled amazing scoring statistics

and dynamic attacking style.

teams. The USA has compiled a record of 62-2-2 in matches in which Hamm

U.S Soccer
star Mia Hamm creates charitable Foundation for researching bone marrow
diseases and encouraging and empowering young female athletes.
US National Soccer Team player and Olympic gold medalist, Mia Hamm, today
announced the creation of a foundation bearing her name. The Mia Hamm Foundation
will be dedicated to raising funds and awareness for two very personal issues
for Hamm: research for bone marrow diseases and the encouragement and empowerment
of young female athletes.
The creation of the Foundation has long been a dream and goal for the
five-time recipient of the U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year award.
The Mia Hamm Foundation will support two major causes very close to Hamm
and her family. Following her brother Garrett's death in 1996 from aplastic
anemia, Hamm pledged to make a difference by helping others who suffer from
the illness. The Mia Hamm Foundation plans to raise funds and make charitable
grants to organizations dedicated to battling bone marrow diseases.
Following the 1996 Olympic Games, Hamm quickly became one of the most
identifiable female athletes in the world. Her dedication, skill and love
of the sport of soccer is apparent every time she steps onto the field.
Recognizing how fortunate she is to have had the opportunity to play soccer,
and the tremendous impact it has had on her life, the second objective of
the Mia Hamm Foundation will be to further the development of programs and
initiatives for young women in sports.
&quot;I am excited to dedicate my time and energy to the Mia Hamm Foundation.
The Foundation represents two causes very close to my heart. Separately,
these two issues have had a profound effect upon me as an individual and
I am committed to raising funds and awareness for them. My goal is to leave
a positive and lasting legacy in the research of bone marrow diseases and
for every female athlete to have the opportunity to play the sports they
love,&quot; said Hamm.
The Mia Hamm Foundation was created with the support of founding partners,
Nike, Mattel and Gatorade. Each company has been a strong supporter of Hamm,
and their commitment includes assistance with the Foundation's fund raising
efforts and special events. &quot;We are thrilled to be able to support
Mia in these issues about which she is so passionate&quot; said Amy Lehr,
Mattel. &quot;In particular, we share her interest for empowering girls
in anything they want to do.&quot;
The first effort by the Mia Hamm Foundation occurs in the latest edition
of Eurosport magazine. In the latest edition, the magazine is offering limited
edition U.S. National Team jerseys and soccer balls autographed by Hamm.
The proceeds from the sales of these items will go to the Mia Hamm Foundation
and the U.S. Soccer Foundation. In addition, promotional partners such as
Women's Sports &amp; Fitness will help support future fundraising events
and endeavors like an inaugural celebrity golf tournament, to be held in
2000.
The Mia Hamm Foundation can be located on the worldwide web at www.miafoundation.org. The web site
and logo, developed by Design Nation, Inc., (Cary, NC) and McKinney &amp;
Silver Design (Raleigh, NC) respectively, will be a source of information
and interactive opportunities to learn more about the Foundation and the
two causes it supports. In addition, information can be obtained by writing:
Mia Hamm Foundation, PO Box 56, Chapel Hill, NC, 27514 or by calling (919)544-2150.
