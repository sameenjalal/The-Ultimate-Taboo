Glass Guide- Cocktail Glass



The Tequila Rose used here gives the drink it's pink color and luscious strawberry flavor while the chocolate liqueur and half and half add richness. This sweet Strawberry Kiss is a heavenly dessert drink that mimics the Red Snapper, save the herbs, and it is an equally deserving Valentine's Day cocktail. It is a very creamy, sweet cocktail, light on the alcohol; two factors that some people adamantly dislike, so use this drink selectively.Ingredients:1 oz Tequila Rose1/2 oz light rum1 oz chocolate liqueur1 oz half and halfPreparation:
Pour all the ingredients into a cocktail shaker with ice cubes. 
Shake well.
Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
