 A blood knight riding atop a warhorse.
Blood knights are an order of nongood knights dedicated to the service of vampirekind.  Many times they can be found under a vampire's servitude, acting as its assassins, battlefield commanders, battlefield guards, sentries, or a source of its gathered information.  Others can be found serving vampirekind.
By feasting on the fresh blood of fallen creatures blood knights gain use of special abilities that resemble vampires' natures.  Their forefront combat-focus, servitude, and special actions make them valuable to those they cooperate with.  Others may find them to have a quite frightening presence; wearing dark, blood-stained armor and surrounded by necromantic magic the first instinct of most ordinary people is to flee in terror.  The most powerful blood knights are vampires.
