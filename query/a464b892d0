At first glance, Jonah Falcon is just another statistic.
Unemployed and living with his mother, Falcon is but one of the 20% of working-age American men without a job.  Yet Falcon has something no other man has: the record for the world's largest penis.
Yes, that's a fact.  
Since being profiled in Rolling Stone and appearing in an HBO documentary about his 13.5 inch penis, the 39-year-old Brooklyn native has struggled to find a steady job and is now living at home with his mother.  
Falcon had been working as a video game reviewer for a website as well as a small-time actor.  But in a recent interview with Sphere, Falcon talks about how he his now "between jobs" due to the "rough economy."  
And despite seemingly being tailor-made for the adult industry, Falcon says that he doesn't do porn because if he did, "Nobody would take me seriously. Nobody."
