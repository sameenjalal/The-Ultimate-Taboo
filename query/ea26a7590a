		Hey im 20 yrs old and im worried about my size as im just barely 5 only when i really flare when im hard. It only made me worry just recently because my cousin (13 yr) is bigger than me. Hard and soft. Is there something wrong with mine?  It makes me too embarrased to want to have sex as i think i am too small. Please i need an answer anyone that knows. My background.....im reasonably healthy. No problems with my health before. But have been cut. I remember mum saying that when they cut me they did it too far back. Could that affect it in anyway??

	Hello, I am 14 and my right ball feels like it's burst and it's just the inner tubes everywhere, and the left is the same. Is that normal or bad?

	It's probably pearly penile papules, do a search for this condition and compare what you have with the condition. PPP's are harmless and naturally occuring.

	I am 13, circumsised recently, and I just wondered if someone could tell me what size I should technically be. I appreciate it differs, but some advice would really help me, as I am paranoid that mine is smaller than other kids!
