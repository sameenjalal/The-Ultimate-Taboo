Bad title




From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia






					Jump to: navigation,

The requested page title is invalid. It may be empty, contain unsupported characters, or include a non-local or incorrectly linked interwiki prefix. You may be able to locate the desired page by searching for its name (with interwiki prefix, if any) in the search box. 
Possible causes are:

 an attempt to follow a link to a diff for a page that has since been deleted;
 an attempt to load a URL such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/| (the | character is not permitted in page titles);
 an attempt to load a URL pointing to a "non-local" interwiki page (usually those not run by the Wikimedia Foundation). For example, the URL http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meatball:WikiPedia will give this error, because the "meatball:" interwiki prefix is not marked as local in the interwiki table. Certain interwiki prefixes are marked as local in the table. For example, the URL http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meta:Main_page can be used to load meta:Main_page. All interlanguage prefixes are marked as local, and thus URLs such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fr:Accueil will work as expected. However, non-local interwiki pages can still be accessed by interwiki linking or by entering them in the search box. For example [[meatball:WikiPedia]] can be used on a page, like this: meatball:WikiPedia.

If you tried to access a non-local interwiki page, you may be able to access that page by clicking the "article" tab on this page.
