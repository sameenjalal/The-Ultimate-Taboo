Inspired by 8-bit Theater, based on the Dungeons and Dragons skit done by The Dead Ale Wives. Video originally published at http://www.cybermoonstudios.comI did NOT create any part of this video. I am merely a reposting fan. See The Dead Ale Wives concerning the audio and Cyber Moon Studios concerning the entire video.

@WovenDeathadder That's like saying &quot;if it weren't for corporate tax rates in California in the 70s, there wouldn't be a Halo&quot;.
True, but sorta irrelevant. With or without D&amp;D, there would﻿ have been video games and there would have been something like Halo or Gears.
