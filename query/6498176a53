James Wyatt

RPG Design Manager
James has been playing D&amp;D since 1979, when he and a friend acquired the first Basic Set. He "self-published" his own campaign world in 10th grade, selling dot-matrix printed copies to friends at school. He began seriously writing for publication in 1996, and his first published appearance in Dragon magazine coincided with the birth of his son in 1997. After four years of writing for Dragon and Dungeon magazines, James joined Wizards of the Coast R&amp;D in January of 2000.
