  Transformer        Transformer A transformer makes use of Faraday's law and the ferromagnetic properties of an iron core to efficiently raise or lower AC voltages. It of course cannot increase power so that if the voltage is raised, the current is proportionally lowered and vice versa.  Show  Calculation  IndexTransformer conceptsMagnetic field concepts  &nbsp;HyperPhysics*****Electricity and magnetismR Nave Go Back           Transformer and Faraday's Law  Faraday's lawSolenoid magnetic fieldCalculation  IndexMagnetic forceTransformer conceptsFaraday's law concepts  &nbsp;HyperPhysics*****Electricity and magnetismR Nave Go Back                Ideal Transformer Calculation     Primary Primary voltage = VP = volts. Primary current  = IP  = amps Primary turns =NP =turns   Secondary Secondary voltage  = VS = volts Secondary current  = IS = amps Secondary turns  = NS = turns Load resistor  = R = ohms   For an ideal transformer:  Power Power used = PP = PS = watts  The ideal transformer neglects losses to resistive heating in the primary coil and assumes ideal coupling to the secondary (i.e., no magnetic losses).   More realistic treatment:Numerical example Calculation with primary losses Notes: For this exploratory calculation, you may enter data for any parameter except the power. Then click on the active text for the parameter you wish to calculate; values will not be forced to be consistent until you do. For primary calculations, the voltage and number of turns in the secondary will be considered to be established and vice versa. Default values will be entered for unspecified parameters, but all values except the power may be changed.
