The Transformers were a staple of virtually every 80&#39;s childhood, combining the awesomeness of vehicles with mundane notions of robots. This week the Something Awful Forum Goons pay tribute to Transformers, by making dozens of new ones just as good as the originals.

		eightcell got this party rollin&#39; by combining his two favorite toy lines. He made about a million pictures this week.

Ecco the Dopefiend was as graceful as a lady when he made this.

eightcell finally has a chance to bring his loved of forced feminization to the forefront.

eightcell makes yet another image that blows.

This Dextromethod robot is adapted at fighting in tight quarters.
