Super Bowl Trailer
Video + Screen Caps  - In case you missed the main event for us fans earlier tonight, a new Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon teaser trailer debuted during the 2nd quarter of the Super Bowl. For your viewing pleasure, we have posted a gallery showcasing every single moment you could want to see from the 30 second clip. Check out all 213 screen captures as well as the trailer itself by clicking here. Let us know what you thought of the trailer on our message board.							




 

TF Infestation #1 Reviewed
The Walking Dead  - IDW introduces a single element to its existing titles which gives us zombies and vampires introduced to the Autobot and Decepticon war (much like they have been introduced into many other mainstream companies titles over the last year), as well as the individual universes of Star Trek, G.I.Joe, and Ghostbusters. The main characters in each brand never actually crossover with one another, but the events themselves do, starting out with an introduction in INFESTATION #1, and then continuing its events into the four main titles' respective individual universes. Read our full review here and share your thoughts about this title.							




 

RTS Deluxe Wave 2 Galleries
Autobots  - Now that you've finally caught your breath after going through our new galleries for Generations Kup and Scourge, our fearless leader Ryan gives us more of the good stuff. This time, we bring you four fantastic new galleries from the Reveal the Shield line: Wreck-Gar, Perceptor, Optimus Prime (G2), and Bumblebee. Hopefully these galleries will tide you over until you can track them down if you're still itching for these to show up on a store shelf near you.							




 

Twincast / Podcast #12
Crash Test 'Cons  - Are you perhaps wondering what the deal is with the Twincast Episode 12 title? It couldn't possibly have to do with an important announcement regarding everyone's favorite yearly Transformers event, could it? Our advice is to bend your ear with the sweet digital resonance of our charming voices for an hour or so. By the end, you'll be treated to information you've no doubt already heard except this time it will be peppered with our endearing (and free) opinions. We also discuss a few other toy related topics, doing our regular take on TF history, and even answer another listener question.							




 

TFA Stunticons @ BotCon 2011
Crush! Destroy!  - Believe it or not, true believers, BotCon 2011 is only a little over 4 months away! The first of several exclusives from this years convention has been revealed, as well as the overall theme of this year's boxset which will be Transformers Animated Stunticons. Love or it hate it, this set has already got Seibertronians hotly debating this concept. Tell us your thoughts by joining our discussion here.
