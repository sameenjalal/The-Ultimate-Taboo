Transformers: Robots in Disguise





Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in her underwear
by Darren &#39;Starscream&#39; Jamieson on January 25, 2011

Following yesterday&#8217;s post where former Transformers actress Megan Fox appeared topless in an advert for Armani jeans it was perhaps only to be expected that the new Transformers actress, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who appears in this summer&#8217;s third Transformers movie &#8216;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#8217; would up the stakes.
Rosie was today seen on the Daily Mail&#8217;s website in a new campaign for Victoria&#8217;s Secret, dressed in a very provacative lingerie set. The model turned actress looked stunning in the underwear for the new campaign, pouting away in a bid to outdo Megan Fox&#8217;s campaign for Armani.
What do you think of Rosie? Are you looking forward to seeing what Transformers 3 director Michael Bay will have her do in the new film?
You can see more of her photos here.

Megan Fox Topless in new ad for Armani
by Darren &#39;Starscream&#39; Jamieson on January 24, 2011

She might not be appearing in Transformers 3, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but former TF siren Megan Fox is still a big hit with Transformers fans and guys everywhere. Megan has just appeared in a new advert for Armani where she bears an uncanny resemblence to Tomb Raider actress Angelina Jolie. In the Armani ad Megan Fox is topless, laying on her front in a pair of tight wight jeans. Some of her many tattoos are visible and she&#8217;s sporting the famous Jolie pout.
Despite her obvious similarity to Jolie, Fox has complained in the past at being compared to 35 year old vixen. In 2009 Megan Fox commented:
“It’s a lack of creativity on the media’s part. Because I have tattoos and dark hair and I was in an action movie? That’s as far as the similarities extend.”

MAJOR Auto Assembly 2011 &amp; 2012 Updates!
by Duh_Prez on January 13, 2011

Auto Assembly 2011 and 2012 Major News

Things have been quiet for the last few months from the Auto Assembly camp,  but with the start of a new year it&#8217;s time for us to make our mark with a  barrage of big announcements to take us into 2011 and beyond&#8230;
While many of you are now starting to make your initial plans about  attending one or more of the Transformers conventions that is taking place this  year (and we hope that Auto Assembly is one of them), we are proud to be able to  announce that we have been working overtime to be able to announce a massive  update to our guest line-up for Auto Assembly 2011&#8230;
But that&#8217;s not all. While many of you are still thinking about 2011, we are  pleased to announce that we have confirmed the first details for Auto Assembly  2012 and we believe that we are the first Transformers convention to do so! You  can find details of the date, venue and much more on our latest news update on  Youtube here &#8211; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASn1s5cE0ks
The video also has the full updates on Auto Assembly 2011 and this is one  video you do NOT want to miss!!
For those of you who have already booked for Auto Assembly 2011, we are  working through a backlog at the moment and emails that we are trying to deal  with which we hope to have sorted shortly. Our committee head has had to deal  with a number of unexpected personal issues over the last few months including  losing his job which has meant that Auto Assembly has had to take a back seat  for a short while but things are starting to return to normal for us now.
As part of this, we are still running behind with despatching the AA2010  Non-Attendee Packages. These should be shipping in a couple of weeks once we  have finalised the original sketches that will be part of these.
Anyway, for those of you who want to attend Auto Assembly 2011, tickets are  available now from our website. Ticket prices are £50 for adults and £38 for  children, students and senior citizens, with under 5s admitted free. One day  tickets are available for the Saturday or Sunday (although these will NOT get  you into the Friday or Saturday evening programmes) and these cost £30 for  adults, £21 for children, students or senior citizens and under 5&#8242;s as always  are free. Family tickets will be available shortly.
The convention is taking place over the weekend of 12th &#8211; 14th August 2011  at the Holiday Inn Birmingham City Centre, Birmingham, England. Tickets for Auto  Assembly 2012 will go on sale later this year.
For more details on  the convention, to see a full list of all the guests and activities taking place  over the weekend, or to book your tickets, visit the website at www.autoassembly.org.uk

We hope to see you all in August!

by Darren &#39;Starscream&#39; Jamieson on October 22, 2010

We at TheTransformers.Net recently interviewed one of the producers on Transformers 3, Lorenzo di Bonaventura. He told us about the new film, where the film&#8217;s climax is taking place and why Chicago was picked as a location. He also talks about some of his influences, and what films he enjoyed growing up. You can hear the interview here:

More than meets the&#8230;.side of a police car.
by sirlagerlot on October 12, 2010

With filming for Transformers 3 well underway in Washington D.C. you could be forgiven for thinking that this was all part of the movie.
Sadly, it wasn&#8217;t. While filming scenes, the Chevrolet Camaro portraying silent hero Bumblebee collided rather unceremoniously with a real-life police vehicle. The vehicle, according to D.C. Police is a part of the Explosives Ordnance Division, and was responding to a bomb threat. Although the roads were closed for filming, the emergency services will take the shortest route to an emergency &#8211; although as it turned out, the drivers shortcut was less than a perfect idea, as he obliviously drove into the path of the bright yellow Autobot
 Evidently, Bumblebees voice isn\&#039;t the only thing Ratchet needs to work on&#8230;

Michael Bay offers reward to find puppy killer
by Darren &#39;Starscream&#39; Jamieson on September 2, 2010

A recent video showing a Bosnian woman throwing a bag of puppies into a river has appalled people all over the world, including Transformers director Michael Bay. Bay was so disgusted by the callas actions of the woman that he offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of the woman.

The video, which we’re not about to show here, shows the woman wearing a red top and laughing as she tosses a bag full of three day old puppies into the river. You can also hear the puppies whimpering as they land in the water.
The actions of this woman have irked animal defence group PETA, and now Bay (currently working on Transformers 3) has offered the reward. Bay is a known dog lover himself and offered the reward via his blog.

FansProject Bruticus review and X-Fire 03 teaser
by Nemesis Scourge on August 21, 2010

daelite20 of the TFW2005 boards has posted a pictorial review of Fansproject&#8217;s Crossfire upgrade set for the Energon gestalt, Bruticus Maximus.
The instructions for this set offer us a tease of their next Crossfire release, which is leading many to guess that the remaining Energon gestalt, Constructicon Maximus (a.k.a. Devastator) will be receiving the same upgrade treatment.
